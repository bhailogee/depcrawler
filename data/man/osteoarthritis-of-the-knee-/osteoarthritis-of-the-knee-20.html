					<h1>Osteoarthritis of the Knee</h1>
<p>A cortisone injection or a series of hyaluronic acid injections (such as Synvisc or Hyalgan) can be helpful, at least temporarily, for osteoarthritis of the knee. Some doctors reserve these for people who have knee swelling and do not offer them to people whose knees have no swelling or signs of inflammation. Neither type of injection can be repeated often. For example, a steroid injection can be safely repeated two or three times per year, while repeated courses of hyaluronic acid injections are not officially approved at all (and some health insurers will not cover repeated courses). If you have tried these and they did not help, other treatment options might work better.</p><p><b>Would you consider having orthopedic surgery?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/osteoarthritis-of-the-knee-22.html">Yes, I would consider having orthopedic surgery.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/osteoarthritis-of-the-knee-21.html">No, I would not consider having orthopedic surgery.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/osteoarthritis-of-the-knee-23.html">I&apos;m ready to quit.</a></p>
