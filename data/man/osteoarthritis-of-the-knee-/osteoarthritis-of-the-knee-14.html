					<h1>Osteoarthritis of the Knee</h1>
<p>That&apos;s good! Exercise can help you maintain optimal body weight and that puts less stress on your knees; it will also help you maintain the range of motion you have, and it will help strengthen muscles (to help take stress off your joints). A physical therapist can help design an exercise program that is good for your knees. Other non-medication options include acupuncture, using a cane, losing excess weight, changing footwear, wearing splints or braces, and massage. Although many of these are unproven as treatments specifically for knee osteoarthritis, future research could prove their benefit.</p><p><b>Have you tried acetaminophen (example: Tylenol)?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/osteoarthritis-of-the-knee-16.html">Yes, I have tried acetaminophen.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/osteoarthritis-of-the-knee-15.html">No, I haven&apos;t tried acetaminophen.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/osteoarthritis-of-the-knee-23.html">I&apos;m ready to quit.</a></p>
