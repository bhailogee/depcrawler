					<h1>Osteoarthritis of the Knee</h1>
<p>Okay. The following questions are to determine whether your arthritis is severe (also called &quot;end-stage&quot;) -- in which case you may need joint replacement surgery to make a big impact -- or whether there might be other conditions complicating your situation for which specific treatment might be effective. Prior therapy is also important to know; if you&apos;ve already failed a particular medicine, it probably makes sense&#xA0;to suggest something else. Finally, your preferences matter; the goal of treatment is to reduce pain and maintain function, so knowing how this condition affects you and how you feel about the risks and benefits of treatment are very important.</p><p><b>Do you have any of the following?</b></p><ul><li><p><b>night pain</b></p></li><li><p><b>constant pain, including pain at rest</b></p></li><li><p><b>reduced function over time due to joint pain.</b></p></li></ul><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/osteoarthritis-of-the-knee-8.html">Yes, I have one or more of those symptoms.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/osteoarthritis-of-the-knee-7.html">No, I have none of those.</a></p>
