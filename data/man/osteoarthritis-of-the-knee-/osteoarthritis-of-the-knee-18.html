					<h1>Osteoarthritis of the Knee</h1>
<p>Okay, if it works well for you, this type of medicine taken regularly or as needed might be the only treatment you need. On the other hand, if you have ulcers or significant kidney disease, these medicines, whether taken over-the-counter or by prescription, might be hazardous. There may be safer pain medicines or anti-inflammatory drugs. Talk with your doctor about whether the anti-inflammatory drugs (including the newer agents, such as celecoxib) or other pain medicines (such as tramadol) are right for you. Also, ask about monitoring - for people taking NSAIDs on a daily basis, blood tests for anemia, kidney and liver function should be checked periodically. Glucosamine is another medicine that may reduce pain (though claims about its ability to heal cartilage are controversial and not widely accepted by most physicians).</p><p><b>Have you tried knee injections?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/osteoarthritis-of-the-knee-20.html">Yes, I have tried injections.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/osteoarthritis-of-the-knee-19.html">No, I have not received injections.</a></p>
