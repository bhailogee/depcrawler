					<h1>Osteoarthritis of the Knee</h1>
<p>Currently, research is looking into the notion that abnormal enzymes released by cartilage cells may lead to cartilage breakdown and joint destruction. Another theory is that some people are born with defective cartilage or slight defects in the way joints fit, and as these people age, they are more likely to experience cartilage breakdown in the joint. Researchers hope that understanding the cause or causes of OA will lead to innovative (and more effective) ways to treat it.</p><p>A number of exciting new therapies are under consideration for osteoarthritis of the knee. Among other approaches, researchers are looking at the potential for cartilage transplant and antibiotics, glucosamine and/or chondroitin to repair or restore the damaged cartilage in OA.</p><p>Studies are under way to assess the benefits of acupuncture, chiropractic care, massage and other alternative therapies in the treatment of OA. While some swear by these methods now, they are considered unproven. Of course, if the results of research studies are positive, that could change.</p><p><b>Would you like to learn more about your particular situation?
