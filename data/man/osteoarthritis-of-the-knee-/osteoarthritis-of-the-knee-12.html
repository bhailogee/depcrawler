					<h1>Osteoarthritis of the Knee</h1>
<p>Okay. Swelling in the knee can occur with OA (though many people with OA notice no knee swelling) and that could mean there is more fluid than is normal. Other types of arthritis can also cause knee swelling, so it might be a good idea to have some of the fluid removed for testing.</p><p>The presence of fluid may also mean that you are more likely to respond to a medication that is injected directly into the knee; there&apos;s more information about that coming up.</p><p><b>Are you already exercising?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/osteoarthritis-of-the-knee-14.html">Yes, I am already exercising.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/osteoarthritis-of-the-knee-13.html">Nope, not exercising -- should I?</a></p>
