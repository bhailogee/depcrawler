The cartilage may be completely worn away and now bone is moving on bone. If that&apos;s the case, treatments other than surgery may help a little, but they are unlikely to help a lot. It may be worth reviewing the situation with an orthopedic surgeon, to discuss what joint replacement surgery or other types of surgery have to offer.</p><p><b>Do you have locking or giving way of the joint?</b></p><p>This question is an attempt to identify a torn or damaged ligament (such as the anterior cruciate ligament) or cartilage (called a meniscus).</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/osteoarthritis-of-the-knee-10.html">Yes, I have locking and/or giving way.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/osteoarthritis-of-the-knee-9.html">No, I have no locking or giving way.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/osteoarthritis-of-the-knee-23.html">I&apos;m ready to quit.</a></p>
