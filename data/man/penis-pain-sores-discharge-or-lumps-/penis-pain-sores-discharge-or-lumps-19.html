You may or may not see blood clots, which can look like small pieces of tissues or coffee grounds. Rarely, red urine may be caused by certain foods or medicine. Your doctor will want to test a sample of your urine to confirm that its red color is caused by blood.</p><p>Blood in the urine may be caused by&#xA0;urinary tract infections,&#xA0;kidney stones &#xA0;and prostate problems.
