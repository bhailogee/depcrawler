					<h1>Headache</h1>
<p>Sinus infections can cause a headache. However, the pain of a sinus infection is usually in the front and tends to be localized to one side of the forehead, around the nose or behind one or both cheeks. The pain from a sinus infection often gets worse when you bend forward. Also mucus from your nose changes color to yellow, green or reddish-brown.</p><p><b>Do your symptoms suggest a sinus infection?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/headache-30.html">Yes, this sounds like me.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/headache-13.html">No, I don&apos;t have these symptoms.</a></p>
