					<h1>Chest Pain</h1>
<p>The most common causes of chest pain that gets worse with deep breathing (called pleuritic chest pain) are a pulled muscle in the chest wall, inflammation of the joints between the ribs and other bones in the chest area, a rib injury, irritation of the lining around the lung or heart and an infection such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Less commonly, pleuritic chest pain is caused by a partially collapsed lung called a pneumothorax or blood clots in the lung (pulmonary emboli).</p><p>The presence of shortness of breath in addition to pleuritic chest pain may indicate a problem that needs immediate medical attention, such as a pneumothorax or pulmonary emboli.</p><p><b>Do you have shortness of breath independent of the chest pain?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/chest-pain-18.html">Yes or I am not sure.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/chest-pain-15.html">No, I am not short of breath.</a></p>
