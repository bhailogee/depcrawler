<p>As mentioned at the start of the guide, any new chest pain requires <b>a conversation with your doctor.</b> As a non-smoker younger than age 40 it is unlikely that your chest pain is caused by fatty blockages in your coronary arteries. But if you have a family history of heart disease at an early age or other risks for coronary heart disease, this is a possibility. Also, some people are born with structural abnormalities of the heart that interfere with normal blood flow and cause chest pain.</p><p><b>After you have made the call to your doctor&apos;s office,</b> please</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/chest-pain-9.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
