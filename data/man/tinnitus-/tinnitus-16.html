					<h1>Tinnitus</h1>
<p>Okay. Thanks for using this guide! We hope it was helpful and that your tinnitus improves soon.</p><p>If none of the conditions mentioned seem to apply to you, it&apos;s possible that your tinnitus is due to a rare cause, has unusual features, or is simply not covered in this guide. For example, pregnancy, atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), and anemia are occasionally associated with tinnitus; however, most people with these conditions do not have tinnitus. A rare cause of tinnitus is a benign brain tumor, called an acoustic neuroma.</p><p>In addition, many people with tinnitus have no identifiable cause.</p><p>It&apos;s important to have this symptom evaluated. Whether a cause can be identified or not, treatment may be available to improve your symptoms.</p>
