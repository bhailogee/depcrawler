For example, did any close relative lose his or her hearing without a clear cause before the age of 40?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/tinnitus-15.html">Yes, I have a family history of early hearing loss.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/tinnitus-14.html">No, I have no family history of early hearing loss.</a></p>
