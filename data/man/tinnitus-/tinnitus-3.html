<p>Okay, sorry to hear that.</p><p>An injury can damage the internal structures of the ear and cause tinnitus. <b>You should contact your doctor for evaluation!</b></p><p>Even though you had an injury, it&apos;s possible that your tinnitus is due to something else.</p><p>Because certain causes of tinnitus are more likely in older people, the next question is about your age.</p><p><b>Are you over the age of 55?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/tinnitus-5.html">Yes, I&apos;m over the age of 55.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/tinnitus-4.html">No, I&apos;m 55 or younger.</a></p>
