					<h1>Knee Pain</h1>
<p>So far, you&apos;ve told us you are older than age 45, joints other than your painful knee also bother you and there is swelling in your knee.</p><p>Just one more question. It has two parts:</p><p><b>1) Do you have locking of the knee? That is, are there times, even briefly, when you cannot move your knee at all?</b></p><p>and</p><p><b>2) Are there times when your knee will not support you?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/knee-pain-34.html">Yes, to one or both questions.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/knee-pain-33.html">No, to both questions.</a></p>
