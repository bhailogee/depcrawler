<p>To recap, you are older than 45, no other joints are bothering you besides the sore knee, and there is swelling in the sore knee.</p><p>There&apos;s just one more question in this guide and it deals with &quot;mechanical symptoms,&quot; such as locking or giving way. When present, these symptoms raise the possibility of torn cartilage or an injured ligament.</p><p>This question has two parts:</p><p><b>1) Do you have locking of the knee? That is, are there times, even briefly, when you cannot move your knee at all?</b></p><p>and</p><p><b>2) Are there times when your knee will not support you?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/knee-pain-27.html">Yes, to one or both questions.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/knee-pain-26.html">No, to both questions.</a></p>
