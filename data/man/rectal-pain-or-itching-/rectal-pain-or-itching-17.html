					<h1>Rectal Pain or Itching</h1>
<p>Since you have a lumps or abnormal tissue around your anus, this is the likely cause of your itching. There are several explanations that are worth considering, either because they are common or because they would be a cause for serious concern.</p><p><b>Hemorrhoids</b></p><p>Hemorrhoids are veins just beneath the inside surface of the rectum and anus. Hemorrhoids can become overfilled and bulging, particularly when straining to push out a bowel movement repeatedly interferes with normal circulation out of these veins. A bulging hemorrhoid can develop a weak area that can allow small amounts of blood to spill into the rectum. Hemorrhoids can cause itching or can soil or moisten your underwear, particularly when they create a bulge that pushes rectal tissue out of your anal opening. Most hemorrhoids do not cause pain, but some can be extremely painful. Pain from hemorrhoids usually comes after a blood clot forms, creating a &quot;thrombosed&quot; hemorrhoid.</p><p><b>Genital warts</b></p><p>Warts in the genital or anal area are caused by a virus infection with &quot;human papillomavirus.&quot; This virus is spread through sexual contact.</p><p><b>Skin tags</b></p><p>Skin tags are flesh-colored pieces of skin that are not cancerous. When they form at the anus, they may be left over from a bulging hemorrhoid that has improved.</p><p><b>Molluscum contagiosum</b></p><p>Molluscum contagiosum is a viral rash that creates small flesh-colored bumps on the skin. It spreads from one person to the next during sexual contact.</p><p><b>Syphilis</b></p><p>Syphilis can cause a rash with lumpy or thickened skin in the anal or genital area. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection. If any itching occurs, it will be mild.</p><p><b>Anal cancer</b></p><p>Cancer at the rim of the anus is sometimes the result of a sexually passed infection, human papillomavirus. Anal cancer is more likely to result from this virus if you are infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Anal cancer may look like a skin sore that will not heal. It commonly causes bleeding with bowel movements.</p>
