<p>Welcome to the Decision Guide for Rectal Pain or Itching.</p><p>This guide can help you to identify some of the causes that are most likely to explain your symptoms and to anticipate the recommendations that your doctor might make.</p><p>Rectal itching or minimal rectal pain can occasionally occur during normal bowel movements. However, significant rectal pain or persisting rectal itching is not normal and can sometimes be caused by a serious medical problem. For significant pain or persistent skin irritation around the rectum, you should always seek an evaluation by your doctor. This guide is intended to be used as a complement to discussions with your doctor, not as a substitute for office-based care.</p><p>If your major symptom is rectal bleeding, constipation, or diarrhea, you may find it more helpful to consult our other Health Decision Guides.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/rectal-pain-or-itching-2.html">Click here to begin.</a></p>
