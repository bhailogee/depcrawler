<p>Based on your answers, one of the most likely causes of your joint pain is a form of crystal-induced arthritis such as gout or pseudogout. The tingling and/or numbness raise the possibility of carpal tunnel syndrome which may accompany wrist swelling.</p><p>In addition, infection is always a possibility when pain is significant, especially if swelling is present. Less likely is another form of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.
