					<h1>Wrist Pain</h1>
<p>Based upon your answers, tendonitis is a likely possibility. Numbness and tingling usually indicate some irritation of a nerve, so carpal tunnel syndrome could also be playing a role in your symptoms; it often accompanies wrist arthritis but may occur without a clear reason. Since you do not describe significant swelling, it&apos;s unlikely that your symptoms are due to inflammation within the joint.</p><p>To decrease pain, rest the wrist and avoid overuse. Over-the-counter pain medications, a splint, and topical treatments (such as IcyHot, BenGay or ice) may help.</p><p>While these measures may help, it is important that you <b>see a physician</b> if symptoms are getting worse or not improving over time.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/wrist-pain-169.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
