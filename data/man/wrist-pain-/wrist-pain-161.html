<p>Based on your answers, some of the most likely causes of your joint pain are a form of crystal-induced arthritis such as gout or pseudogout; the tingling and numbness may be due to carpal tunnel syndrome, a common problem when the wrist is swollen.</p><p>In addition, infection is always a possibility when pain is significant, especially if swelling is present. Less likely is another form of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis (which generally causes bony enlargement but no true swelling) or rheumatoid arthritis (which usually affects multiple joints).</p><p>While over-the-counter pain medicines, a splint, rest and ice may be helpful, it is important that you <b>see a physician</b> to evaluate these symptoms.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/wrist-pain-169.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
