					<h1>Wrist Pain</h1>
<p>Based upon your answers, tendonitis, wrist sprain or a muscle strain are more likely than a problem within the joint. However, if you have had prior injury or history of arthritis, osteoarthritis of the wrist is also a possibility.</p><p>To decrease pain, rest the wrist and avoid overuse. Over-the-counter pain medications, a splint, and topical treatments (such as IcyHot, BenGay or ice) may help.</p><p>While these measures may help, it is important that you <b>see a physician</b> if symptoms are getting worse or not improving over time.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/wrist-pain-169.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
