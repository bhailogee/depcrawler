					<h1>Lightheaded with Standing</h1>
					<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Welcome.</p><p>People say they feel dizzy when describing a variety of sensations. This guide is designed to address one type of dizziness, a feeling of lightheadedness when you stand up that gets better when you lie down. You will be asked a short series of questions that will lead you to information pertinent to your symptoms.</p><p>A lightheaded feeling may vary from a vague sense that your brain is &quot;not clear&quot; to the dramatic symptom of feeling like you will faint when you stand up.</p><p>Normally when you stand up, your blood pressure falls for a few seconds, but then rises to make sure that your brain gets enough blood flow. Becoming lightheaded when moving from a lying position to sitting or standing usually means that your blood pressure has fallen inappropriately. Doctors call this postural hypotension.</p><p>If your dizziness does not fit this description, then please visit our guide titled <b>New Onset Dizziness</b>.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/lightheaded-with-standing-2.html">Let&apos;s get started.</a></p>
