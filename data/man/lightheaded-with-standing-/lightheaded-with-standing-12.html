					<h1>Lightheaded with Standing</h1>
<p>Some people are prone to getting lightheaded, especially people who have fainted in the past. Doctors call simple fainting spells vasodepressor syncope.</p><p>Normally when blood pressure starts to fall our heart rate speeds up to compensate. During a simple faint, blood pressure falls and heart rate does the opposite of what it should -- it slows down. If you are standing, not enough blood gets pumped to the brain.</p><p><b>Have you had fainting or near fainting spells in the past?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/lightheaded-with-standing-14.html">Yes, I have fainting or near fainting spells.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/lightheaded-with-standing-13.html">No, this hasn&apos;t happened to me.</a></p>
