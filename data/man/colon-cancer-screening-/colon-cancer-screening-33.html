					<h1>Colon Cancer Screening</h1>
<p>Your risk of colon cancer is moderately increased if two or more first-degree relatives (father, mother, sister or brother) were diagnosed with colon cancer or colon polyps. You should have your first colonoscopy at <b>age 40</b>, or at least ten years before the age at which the youngest family member was diagnosed. Colonoscopy should be repeated <b>every five years.</b></p>
