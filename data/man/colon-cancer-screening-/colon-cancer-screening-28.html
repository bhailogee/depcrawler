					<h1>Colon Cancer Screening</h1>
<p>Some individuals have a gene that puts them at high risk for colon cancer. This type of family cancer gene may be suspected if several other family members have been diagnosed with colon cancer. This is particularly true if these family members were diagnosed before age 50 or were spread across several generations.</p><p>Family adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) are two well-recognized family colon cancer syndromes.</p><p><b>Talk with your doctor</b> if you suspect your family may carry one of these genes, or if one of these conditions is known to run in your family. You may need early and frequent screening, or you may be a candidate for genetic testing.</p>
