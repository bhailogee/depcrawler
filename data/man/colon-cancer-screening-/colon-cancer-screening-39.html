					<h1>Colon Cancer Screening</h1>
<p>Knowing what types of polyps you&apos;ve had is important, since only certain types of polyps increase your risk for colon cancer. You can request information from your doctor to help answer this question. A pathology report (microscopic examination of the polyp that was removed) will be most helpful.</p><p>If you cannot find information that tells you what types of polyps you&apos;ve had, it probably makes sense to have a full colonoscopy three to five years after your most recent examination. You can <b>talk to your doctor</b> about a specific plan for follow-up.</p>
