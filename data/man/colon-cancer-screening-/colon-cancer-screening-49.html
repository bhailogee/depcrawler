					<h1>Colon Cancer Screening</h1>
<p>People who have been diagnosed and treated for colon cancer usually have a complete bowel examination (colonoscopy) as part of their evaluation. <b>If you did not have a colonoscopy prior to your treatment, this should be completed with six months of your diagnosis.</b></p><p>Even if you have had a normal colonoscopy, you will still need periodic examinations to ensure that cancer and pre-cancerous polyps have not returned. A typical schedule for follow-up examinations would include</p><ul><li><p>a colonoscopy one year after your diagnosis, followed by</p></li><li><p>a repeat colonoscopy in three additional years, then</p></li><li><p>screening colonoscopy every three to five years indefinitely.</p></li></ul><p>Be sure to <b>speak with your doctor</b> if you have missed any of these follow-up examinations, or if you have general questions about your diagnosis of colon cancer.</p>
