					<h1>Colon Cancer Screening</h1>
<p>People who develop colon cancer and certain types of colon polyps are at increased risk for developing pre-cancerous polyps in the future. They are also at risk for developing full-blown colon cancer -- even a second time. It&apos;s therefore important to have regular screening to find and remove polyps before they become cancerous.</p><p>Your risk of polyps and cancer depends on your particular situation.</p><p><b>Choose the statement that describes your history:</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/colon-cancer-screening-49.html">I have been diagnosed with colon cancer in the past.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/colon-cancer-screening-38.html">I have been diagnosed with colon polyps in the past.</a></p>
