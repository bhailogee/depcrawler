					<h1>Colon Cancer Screening</h1>
<p>Adenomatous polyps are usually benign, but have some potential to become cancerous if they are not removed. A person who has been diagnosed with adenomatous polyps needs regular follow-up. The exact schedule for follow-up depends on the size, number and microscopic appearance of the polyps that are removed.</p><p><b>Most people with adenomatous polyps should have a repeat (&quot;surveillance&quot;) colonoscopy in three to five years.</b> However, very large polyps or polyps with precancerous features may warrant a repeat colonoscopy in as little as two to six months. Your doctor can advise you on an appropriate follow-up schedule.</p>
