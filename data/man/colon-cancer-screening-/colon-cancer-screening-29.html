					<h1>Colon Cancer Screening</h1>
<p>People with longstanding inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn&apos;s disease or ulcerative colitis, are at <b>high risk</b> for developing colon cancer. This risk of colon cancer goes up over time. Most people who have had inflammatory bowel disease for longer than eight years will need a colonoscopy <b>every one to two years, indefinitely</b>. You should <b>consult with your doctor</b> for a specific recommendation. Work with your health care providers to make sure that your screening is performed on a regular basis.</p>
