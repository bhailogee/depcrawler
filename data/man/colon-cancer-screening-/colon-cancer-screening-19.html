					<h1>Colon Cancer Screening</h1>
<p>Congratulations on having been screened for colon cancer. Screening is one of the best ways to lower your risk of developing this common and deadly type of cancer.</p><p>Since colon cancer can develop at any time, screening needs to be repeated on a regular basis. The timing and type of your next screening test depends on whether your previous screening was normal, and what type of screening test you had. For example, people who have been diagnosed with certain types of colon polyps should have a follow-up colonoscopy every five years.</p><p><b>What was the result of your last colon cancer screening test?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/colon-cancer-screening-42.html">My last screening test was normal.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/colon-cancer-screening-20.html">My last screening test was not normal.</a></p>
