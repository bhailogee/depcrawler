					<h1>Foot Pain</h1>
<p>You may have a plantar wart&#xA0;-- also called a &quot;plantar&apos;s wart&quot; --&#xA0;it has nothing to do with planting or gardening (and is spelled differently from &quot;planter&quot;). The name comes from the surface of the foot that is usually affected -- the sole of the foot is called the &quot;plantar&quot; side while the top of the foot is called the &quot;dorsal&quot; side. Plantar warts are common, can be very painful and are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). The good news is that they are treatable and generally curable. <b>Contact your physician</b> for evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and to begin treatment.</p><p><b>Would you like more information about these and other common causes of foot pain?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/foot-pain-28.html">Yes, I&apos;d like to learn more!</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/foot-pain-27.html">No, I&apos;m all set, thanks, ready to quit.</a></p>
