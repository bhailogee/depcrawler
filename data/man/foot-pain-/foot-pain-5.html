Unless you have been instructed not to do so, try acetaminophen or an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicine (such as ibuprofen or naproxen) and <b>contact your doctor if symptoms do not improve over a week or two.</b></p><p>Just a few more questions....again, please forgive these personal questions!</p><p><b>Are you overweight?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/foot-pain-7.html">Yes, I am overweight.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/foot-pain-6.html">No, I am not overweight.</a></p>
