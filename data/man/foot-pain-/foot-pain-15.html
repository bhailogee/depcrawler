<p>Good! The tough, raised patch of skin on the bottom of your foot may just be a callous that has nothing to do with your foot pain. Still, if you have a callous, it could indicate abnormal pressure being applied to one part of your foot. That&apos;s the sort of situation that often happens with flat feet, poorly fitting shoes, or other mechanical cause of foot pain.</p><p><b>Contact your doctor</b> if the pain persists; he or she may recommend that you see a specialist in foot care, a podiatrist, for evaluation.</p><p><b>Would you like more information about these and other common causes of foot pain?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/foot-pain-27.html">No, I&apos;m all set, thanks, ready to quit.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/foot-pain-28.html">Yes, I&apos;d like to learn more!</a></p>
