					<h1>Foot Pain</h1>
<p>That&apos;s good. So, your pain did not begin after a significant injury, there&apos;s no redness or swelling in the foot, there&apos;s no tender, raised patch of skin on the bottom of the foot or toes, pain is not provoked by running, walking or worse first thing in the morning, and you have no numbness or tingling in the area.</p><p>In the absence of these common symptoms, evaluation in person will be important to understand the cause of your pain. It is possible that you have a flat foot, an injury you don&apos;t recall, or even a stress fracture to account for your symptoms. If pain is confined to the toenail, an ingrown nail may be to blame. But there are many other possibilities.</p><p><b>Call your doctor</b><b>if your symptoms persist for more than one month, but call sooner if they worsen.</b></p><p><b>Would you like more information about these and other common causes of foot pain?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/foot-pain-27.html">No, I&apos;m all set, thanks, ready to quit.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/foot-pain-28.html">Yes, I&apos;d like to learn more!</a></p>
