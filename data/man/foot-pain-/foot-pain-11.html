					<h1>Foot Pain</h1>
<p>These are symptoms that commonly arise from an irritated or injured nerve. If both feet are affected, a&#xA0;neuropathy (which means &quot;nerve disease&quot;) could be to blame. There are many causes of neuropathy, such as diabetes and vitamin B12 deficiency. If only one foot has these symptoms, a disc problem in the lower spine, or a nerve compression in the groin, lower leg or ankle could be causing this.</p><p><b>Would you like more information about these and other common causes of foot pain?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/foot-pain-27.html">No, I&apos;m all set, thanks, ready to quit.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/foot-pain-28.html">Yes, I&apos;d like to learn more!</a></p>
