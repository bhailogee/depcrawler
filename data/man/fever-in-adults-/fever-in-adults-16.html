					<h1>Fever in Adults</h1>
<p>Sorry to hear that. Your symptoms raise the possibility that your fever is caused by a stomach flu, other intestinal infection, or diverticulitis. If you have nausea and widespread abdominal pain that becomes more localized to the right lower part of the abdomen, appendicitis is a possibility. So, <b>contact your doctor for prompt evaluation</b>, especially if abdominal pain is a prominent part of the picture.</p><p>The next question is to determine whether you may have a skin infection:</p><p><b>Does your skin have a patch of redness and warmth that&apos;s spreading?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/fever-in-adults-18.html">Yes, I do have a rash like that.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/fever-in-adults-17.html">No, I haven&apos;t noticed that.</a></p>
