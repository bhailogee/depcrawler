					<h1>Fever in Adults</h1>
					<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Welcome to this symptom guide about fever. Sorry to hear you have a fever!</p><p>This guide is intended for adults who have an abnormally elevated temperature. Although we think of normal body temperature as 98.6 degrees F, body temperature varies -- and so does the definition of fever. Since body temperature rarely climbs above 99.9 degrees without a reason, this guide will consider a fever to be present when the body temperature is 100.0 F (38 degrees C) or higher. While temperatures between 98.6 and 99.9 degrees might be high for you, minor elevations in temperature are less likely to be a true indication of illness and are often within the range of normal variation.</p><p>There are many causes of fever. This guide will cover some of the most common, but it is not exhaustive; rarer causes will not be covered.</p><p>This guide is not intended to replace a face-to-face meeting with your doctor about your symptoms. Many causes of fever require an in-person examination and testing to diagnose. However, this guide may be particularly helpful while awaiting a visit to your doctor or after your initial evaluation.</p><p>Okay. To begin, here&apos;s a two-part question:</p><p><b>1. Is your temperature greater than 104 degrees F?</b></p><p><b>2. Along with fever, do you have any of the following?</b></p><p><b>- Severe headache</b></p><p><b>- Shortness of breath</b></p><p><b>- Lethargy or confusion</b></p><p><b>- A rapidly spreading rash</b></p><p><b>- An inability to drink fluids</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/fever-in-adults-23.html">Yes, one or more of those is true for me.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/fever-in-adults-2.html">No, none of those is true for me.</a></p>
