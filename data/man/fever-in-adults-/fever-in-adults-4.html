<p>Sorry to hear that -- a fever and cough might be caused by pneumonia, bronchitis, or another respiratory infection. Because these infections can be serious and you may need antibiotics, it&apos;s important that you see your doctor for an evaluation.</p><p>The next question has 3 parts:</p><p><b>1. Have you been exposed to anyone who has tuberculosis</b><b>?</b></p><p><b>2. Have you lived in a place where tuberculosis is common?</b></p><p><b>3. Have you ever had a positive skin test for tuberculosis?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/fever-in-adults-6.html">Yes, one or more of those is true.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/fever-in-adults-5.html">No, none of those is true for me.</a></p>
