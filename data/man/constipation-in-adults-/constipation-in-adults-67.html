<p><b>Minimize your gas</b></p><p>Bloating may arise from excessive gas production in the colon. Poor digestion of carbohydrates is frequently a cause of gas, since bacteria may ferment these carbohydrates within the colon.</p><p>Carbohydrates that are culprit because they can be indigestible include:</p><p><b>Lactose</b></p><p>This is the milk sugar found in dairy products. If you are lactose &quot;intolerant,&quot; then you can&apos;t digest this carbohydrate easily.</p><p><b>Sweeteners</b></p><p>The carbohydrates mannitol, sorbitol, and fructose are added to many liquid medicines, health foods, juices, candies, and chewing gum.</p><p>Certain foods also contain fructose, including figs, dates, prunes, pears and grapes, onions, asparagus, artichokes, wheat, and dietetic cookies and cakes.</p><p><b>Cruciferous vegetables and legumes</b></p><p>The natural carbohydrates raffinose or stachyose are not digested well by humans. They are found in cabbage, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, and beans.</p><p>Fiber can also cause gas, especially if it is increased rapidly in your diet or by supplements.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/constipation-in-adults-68.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
