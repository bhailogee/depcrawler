<p>Since you have difficulty moving stool through your pelvis, it is possible that you have poorly coordinated muscle function in this area as a cause of your constipation. It may be worth your while to undergo specialized testing of your pelvic muscle function.</p><p>A video study called &quot;defecography&quot; can observe whether your pelvic and anal muscle movements are appropriately coordinated during a &quot;practice&quot; bowel movement. A thick liquid called barium is used to fill the rectum for this test, or a small balloon may be inflated in your rectum. Rectal pressures can be measured.</p><p>These tests usually require an evaluation by a specialist.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/constipation-in-adults-52.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
