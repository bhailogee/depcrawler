					<h1>Constipation in Adults</h1>
<p>Your symptoms suggest &quot;uterine prolapse.&quot;</p><p>In other words, the position of your pelvic organs may be interfering with the passage of stool through your pelvis. Downward sagging (prolapse) of the uterus or bladder can develop with age and is particularly common following childbirth.</p><p>As a part of your constipation evaluation (and before other specialized pelvic tests) you may benefit from having a pelvic examination that specifically checks for prolapse of the bladder or uterus. This examination may either be performed by your primary care doctor or by a gynecologist.</p><p>Prolapse of the uterus or bladder is not an emergency and does not necessarily require correction. However, identification of a prolapsed uterus or bladder may be helpful in treating your constipation.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/constipation-in-adults-48.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
