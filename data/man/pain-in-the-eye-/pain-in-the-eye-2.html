					<h1>Pain in the Eye</h1>
<p>If one or both of your eyes are irritated or itchy and red, then you may have conjunctivitis.&#xA0;Conjunctivitis is most commonly caused by a viral infection or allergy. Chemical exposure and bacterial infection are also possible.</p><p>Bacterial conjunctivitis needs treatment with antibiotics. Viral conjunctivitis will usually get better without specific therapy. However, it can be difficult to determine whether the infection is bacterial or viral without an examination by a health professional. Avoid touching the eye because viral conjunctivitis can be contagious.</p><p>Allergic conjunctivitis can be treated with non-prescription antihistamine eye drops or oral antihistamine pills.</p><p>Mild eye discomfort can be treated at home by resting your eyes and avoiding bright lights.</p>
