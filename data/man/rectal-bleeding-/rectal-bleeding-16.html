					<h1>Rectal Bleeding</h1>
<p><b>Your bleeding is of&#xA0;more concern because of your personal or family history.</b></p><p>Most people with minimal rectal bleeding do not have a dangerous cause of their symptoms. However, you should <b>see your doctor promptly</b> because your likelihood of having colorectal cancer is increased, based upon your symptoms. People over age 50 are at a higher risk for cancer. Your doctor will probably recommend a colonoscopy to carefully examine your colon.</p><p>Certain other medical illnesses such as &quot;inflammatory bowel disease&quot; can cause symptoms that are similar to those of a colon cancer. Inflammatory bowel disease is the result of an autoimmune illness (an attack by your own immune system). Most inflammatory bowel disease is eventually identified as either &quot;Crohn&apos;s disease&quot; or &quot;ulcerative colitis.&quot; Inflammatory bowel disease is more likely to be an explanation for your diarrhea if you are a young adult, although older adults can develop inflammatory bowel disease as well.</p>
