					<h1>Sudden Hearing Loss</h1>
<p>Okay. We hope your hearing improves soon and that this guide was helpful.</p><p>If none of the conditions mentioned seem to apply to you, it&apos;s possible that your hearing loss is due to something simple, such as fluid in the ear canal (after swimming or a shower), or a buildup of wax, called cerumenosis. Or, it could be due to a rare cause not covered here.</p><p>In addition, many people with hearing loss have no identifiable cause; when no cause can be found, it&apos;s called idiopathic hearing loss.</p><p>Even without a clear cause, treatment may be available to reverse the hearing loss.</p><p>Sudden hearing loss deserves prompt evaluation, so <b>let your doctor know about your symptoms!</b></p>
