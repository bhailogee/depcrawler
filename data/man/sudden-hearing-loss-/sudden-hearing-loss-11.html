					<h1>Sudden Hearing Loss</h1>
<p>Okay, great. There are just a few more questions.</p><p>Because certain medications can cause hearing loss, we&apos;d like to move on to some questions about that. About 5% of hearing loss is related to exposure to a medication or toxin. For example, certain antibiotics, chemotherapy, high-dose aspirin, and diuretic medications (&quot;water pills&quot; such as furosemide) may cause hearing loss. Fortunately, recognition of the problem and stopping the medicine can prevent permanent hearing loss.</p><p><b>Did you start taking any new medications shortly before the onset of hearing loss?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/sudden-hearing-loss-13.html">Yes, I recently started a new medication.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/sudden-hearing-loss-12.html">No, I haven&apos;t started taking any new medications.</a></p>
