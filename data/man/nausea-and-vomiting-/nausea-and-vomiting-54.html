					<h1>Nausea and Vomiting</h1>
<p>Your symptoms (nausea or vomiting, fever, and brief episodes of abdominal pain) are very consistent with a viral infection that is primarily affecting your stomach and intestinal tract, known as &quot;gastroenteritis.&quot; This condition is sometimes referred to as &quot;the stomach flu.&quot; Many different viruses can cause gastroenteritis. Most of them also cause diarrhea, but that symptom can lag behind the symptoms you are experiencing.</p><p>You do not necessarily require evaluation for your symptoms since they have been occurring for fewer than five days. <b>If your symptoms persist longer than a week or if they are not clearly improving on their own by the time you are in your third day of symptoms, then you need to see your doctor.</b> Vomiting or diarrhea can deplete you of fluids and electrolytes, so repeated vomiting or diarrhea requires medical treatment if it results in a lasting lightheaded feeling or weakness.</p>
