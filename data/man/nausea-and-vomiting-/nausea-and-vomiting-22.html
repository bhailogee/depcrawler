					<h1>Nausea and Vomiting</h1>
<p><b>The appearance of your vomit or stools suggests that you have hemorrhaged into your digestive tract. This is an emergency, as your bleeding may be continuing or may soon recur. Seek emergency care immediately.</b></p><p>It is impossible to know the source of your bleeding without tests. Common causes of bleeding that result in recurring nausea and vomiting include an ulcer in the stomach or duodenum, severe irritation of the stomach lining (&quot;gastritis,&quot;) a leak from one or more congested veins in the esophagus (these congested veins are a complication of liver disease and are called &quot;esophageal varices&quot;), and stomach or other digestive tract cancers.</p><p>It is likely that your evaluation will include an endoscopy test (esophagogastroduodenoscopy, or &quot;EGD&quot;). With this test, a doctor can view the inside of your esophagus, stomach, and the first segment of your small intestine by way of a flexible tube and camera.</p><p>Click below for more information:</p><p>gastric cancer (stomach cancer)</p><p>esophageal cancer</p>
