					<h1>Nausea and Vomiting</h1>
<p>Food poisoning is a good explanation for your symptoms.</p><p>If your nausea or vomiting began within a few hours of your suspicious meal, the food may have been contaminated with a toxin. Fortunately, food poisoning symptoms go away on their own without treatment if they are caused by a toxin. Vomiting and abdominal cramps usually last less than a full day, but diarrhea and changes in your appetite and digestion may linger for up to one week.</p><p>If your symptoms took several days to develop after your suspicious food exposure, you may have a bacterial infection in your intestine. Your doctor might request that you provide a stool sample, so you can be checked for an infection with <i>salmonella, shigella, campylobacters</i>, or an aggressive strain of e<i>. coli.</i> Infections with one of these bacteria types may require antibiotic treatment.</p><p>If you have more than a few episodes of vomiting or diarrhea, you may become significantly dehydrated as a result of food poisoning. Treatment with intravenous (IV) fluids might be necessary. <b>If you notice dizziness or feel that you are losing fluid faster than you can keep up with by drinking, you should contact your doctor urgently.</b> Your doctor&apos;s care is especially important if you are elderly or have heart disease or diabetes.</p>
