					<h1>Nausea and Vomiting</h1>
<p>It is reassuring that you have not had a recent head blow, because nausea or vomiting after a head injury can be a sign of a bleeding emergency. Other brain or nervous system causes of your nausea or vomiting should be considered if you are having another symptom, such as a headache, dizziness, or a problem with your vision (blurred or blocked vision), that brings our attention to your brain or nervous system.</p><p><b>Do you have a headache, dizziness, or a new vision problem?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nausea-and-vomiting-39.html">Yes, I do have a headache, dizziness, or a vision problem.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nausea-and-vomiting-28.html">No, I do not have these symptoms.</a></p>
