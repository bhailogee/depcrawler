					<h1>Nausea and Vomiting</h1>
<p>You are reporting several symptoms, including nausea or vomiting, fever, and vertigo. The diagnosis that most closely matches your symptoms is a viral infection within your balance control center near to your inner ear. This type of infection is called &quot;labrynthitis.&quot; Labrynthitis is not a dangerous condition, but it is quite uncomfortable. Your doctor may be able to prescribe medication to minimize your nausea and other symptoms if this is determined to be your diagnosis.</p>
