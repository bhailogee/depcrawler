					<h1>Nausea and Vomiting</h1>
<p>You are having nausea or vomiting without other symptoms or history. That helps us to easily point to a likely source. If you develop any of the other symptoms that we introduced in this program, you may be able to gain helpful information by repeating this program.</p><p><b>Remember, repeated episodes of nausea and vomiting can arise from a variety of medical causes, including some serious conditions. Everyone who has unexplained nausea and vomiting that persists for longer than a week requires a medical evaluation by a doctor. Vomiting can deplete you of fluids and electrolytes, so repeated vomiting requires medical treatment if it results in a lasting lightheaded feeling or weakness.</b></p><p>Your doctor may be able to identify a likely source of your symptoms due to his or her familiarity with your more detailed medical history or health conditions. Your doctor is likely to begin your evaluation with an examination and blood tests. If your symptoms persist, it may be worthwhile for you to have an inspection of your stomach and the first part of your intestine. The most common way that this is accomplished is by the procedure &quot;esophagogastroduodenoscopy&quot; (&quot;EGD&quot; or &quot;upper endoscopy.) In this procedure, a doctor can view the inside of your upper digestive tract by way of a flexible tube and camera.</p>
