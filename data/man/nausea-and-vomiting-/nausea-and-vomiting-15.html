					<h1>Nausea and Vomiting</h1>
<p><b>Your nausea or vomiting is especially concerning, because weight loss can signify impaired nutrition or can suggest a serious medical illness, such as cancer. Your symptoms warrant a thorough evaluation by a doctor without delay.</b></p><p>The following illnesses are some of the ones that are most classically associated with weight loss in addition to nausea or vomiting. Other less serious diagnoses are also possible, but your weight loss should be a significant focus of your evaluation.</p><p><b>Gastroparesis (Delayed Stomach Emptying)</b></p><p>When the stomach is abnormally slow to empty this can cause nausea, vomiting of undigested food, bloating, and a feeling of fullness after only a partial meal. Slow emptying of the stomach is known as gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is common in people who are vulnerable to nerve injury, including people with diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson&apos;s disease, or other causes of neuropathy.</p><p><b>Hepatitis</b></p><p>Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver, and it can result in severe liver scarring called &quot;cirrhosis.&quot; Hepatitis B and hepatitis C are viral infections that commonly cause weight loss and nausea or vomiting and may be associated with abdominal pain. These are the most common causes of chronic hepatitis. Hepatitis B is most commonly spread through sexual contact. Hepatitis C is most commonly spread through contact with contaminated blood. Other forms of hepatitis (that are not the result of viruses) can also occur.</p><p><b>Alcohol Abuse</b></p><p>Alcohol can cause all of the symptoms you are having when it is consumed regularly. Alcohol can result in inflammation of the stomach or intestine, causing nausea or vomiting, and it can interfere with your normal eating habits and nutrition.</p><p><b>Adrenal Insufficiency</b></p><p>The adrenal glands (one above each kidney) make the necessary body hormone &quot;cortisol.&quot; It is possible for both adrenal glands to malfunction. This is more likely if you have required prolonged prednisone treatment, if you are infected with HIV, or if you have been diagnosed with premature menopause, type 1 diabetes, or thyroid disease. Nausea and vomiting, weight loss, abdominal pain, and low blood pressure can occur when the adrenal glands are not functioning properly.</p><p><b>A Mass or Cancer in the Abdomen</b></p><p>Any large mass or object in the abdomen can put pressure on the stomach and result in nausea or vomiting, particularly after meals. Examples of masses or objects that put pressure on the stomach are abnormally enlarged organs (particularly the liver or spleen), lymph nodes that are enlarged due to an infection or cancer, or a tumor.</p><p><b>Stress, Anxiety or Depression</b></p><p>Anxiety and depression can result in nausea or vomiting and they also may result in weight loss. Medications that treat anxiety or depression may cause nausea, vomiting, or weight loss as side effects.</p><p>Click below for more information:</p><p>diabetic neuropathies (including gastroparesis)</p><p>alcohol dependence</p><p>stomach cancer</p><p>cancer of the pancreas</p><p>ovarian cancer</p><p>gallbladder and bile duct cancers</p><p>colorectal cancer</p><p>lymphoma</p>
