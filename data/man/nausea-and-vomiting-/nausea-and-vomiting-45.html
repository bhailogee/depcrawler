<p>When both nausea or vomiting and fever are present, one symptom that can suggest a specific diagnosis is &quot;vertigo.&quot; Vertigo is a form of dizziness. It is a spinning or falling sensation that you feel at times when you are not actually in motion, or an exaggerated perception of motion. Vertigo episodes may be triggered by sudden head movements or rolling over.</p><p><b>Are you having episodes of vertigo (head spinning)?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nausea-and-vomiting-55.html">Yes, I am having vertigo episodes.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nausea-and-vomiting-46.html">No, I do not have vertigo.</a></p>
