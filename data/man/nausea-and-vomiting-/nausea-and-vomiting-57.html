					<h1>Nausea and Vomiting</h1>
<p><b>You have symptoms that suggest you may have an infection in your urinary tract. If you do have an infection in the urinary tract, your fever, nausea and vomiting make it likely that this infection involves the kidney. A kidney infection is a serious problem named pyelonephritis.</b><b>You should be evaluated by a doctor today in case you need antibiotic treatment.</b></p><p>A kidney infection can sometimes be treated with antibiotics at home, and sometimes requires treatment in the hospital through an intravenous (IV) line. Since you are having vomiting, you might not be able to keep down antibiotics that you take by mouth. A doctor can quickly identify whether you have an infection in your urinary tract by testing your urine, and then you can discuss whether you will require antibiotics at home or in the hospital.</p>
