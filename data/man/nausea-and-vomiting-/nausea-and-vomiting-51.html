					<h1>Nausea and Vomiting</h1>
<p><b>When pain in the left abdomen accompanies nausea or vomiting and fever, it is possible that an infection in or near to the colon is the source of illness. You may require urgent antibiotic treatment! Seek medical care today.</b></p><p>The two most dangerous infections that can result in fever, left-sided abdominal pain, and nausea or vomiting are both common conditions. They are &quot;diverticulitis&quot; and &quot;colitis.&quot; Colitis is usually accompanied by diarrhea. Colitis that has only caused symptoms for several days is most commonly caused by an infection (in this case, it is usually a complication of antibiotic use).</p><p><b>Diverticulitis</b></p><p>Small bulges that protrude sideways from the colon can appear with age, and these are known as diverticuli. Just as your appendix can become infected, so can diverticuli. When this occurs, a pocket of pus that is rich with bacteria can create a dangerous infection.</p><p><b>Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea (Colitis)</b></p><p>Fever and abdominal symptoms can arise from an infection that can be the after-effect of antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic treatment can kill and clear away some harmless bacteria types in the colon, making room for the expansion of a strain called <i>Clostridium difficile</i> that can survive treatment with some antibiotic types. Usually, an infection with this bacteria results in diarrhea in addition to other symptoms.</p><p>Click below for more information:</p><p>diverticulitis</p><p>antibiotic-associated diarrhea</p>
