					<h1>Nausea and Vomiting</h1>
<p>You have nausea or vomiting and fever, but you have not yet reported any specific symptoms to help to identify the underlying cause. The most common problem that results in your symptoms is a viral infection that primarily affects your stomach and intestinal tract, known as &quot;gastroenteritis.&quot; This condition is sometimes referred to as &quot;the stomach flu.&quot; Many different viruses can cause gastroenteritis. Most of them also cause diarrhea--this is one symptom we have not asked you about yet. Diarrhea can lag behind the symptoms you are experiencing so gastroenteritis is likely whether or not you have had new episodes of diarrhea.</p><p>You do not necessarily require evaluation for your symptoms since they have been occurring for fewer than five days. Keep watch for the symptoms we have inquired about in this guide, since they may suggest another diagnosis.</p><p><b>If your symptoms persist longer than a week or if they are not clearly improving on their own by the time you are in your third day of symptoms, then you need</b><b>to see your doctor. Vomiting can deplete you of fluids and electrolytes, so</b><b>repeated vomiting requires medical treatment if it results in a lasting lightheaded feeling or weakness.</b></p>
