					<h1>Nausea and Vomiting</h1>
<p>There are several complications of diabetes that could explain your nausea or vomiting. <b>Please discuss your diabetes with your doctor so that these possibilities can be considered.</b></p><p><b>Hypoglycemic Spells</b></p><p>Nausea or vomiting can occur as a symptom of a low blood sugar. Other common symptoms include sudden tremulousness, sweating, anxiety, headache, a racing heart rate, or confusion. Low blood sugar episodes are dangerous. If you are having recurring hypoglycemia episodes, you should discuss your diabetes treatment with your doctor right away.</p><p><b>Gastroparesis (Delayed Stomach Emptying)</b></p><p>When the stomach is abnormally slow to empty this can cause nausea, vomiting of undigested food, bloating, and a feeling of fullness after only a partial meal. Slow emptying of the stomach is known as gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is common in people who are vulnerable to nerve injury, including people with diabetes.</p><p><b>Diabetic Ketoacidosis</b></p><p>A complication that occurs most commonly in people with type 1 diabetes is ketoacidosis. This is an emergency that results when the body has too little insulin, or when insulin is made much less effective due to a severe illness or infection. The liver manufactures ketones when insulin is inadequate or ineffective, and ketones result in nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Ketoacidosis is life-threatening because it is associated with profound dehydration.</p><p>Click for more information on diabetic neuropathies (including gastroparesis).</p>
