					<h1>Nausea and Vomiting</h1>
<p><b>Because you are having symptoms that could come from a heart attack, you need to get emergency help.</b></p><p>Your chest symptoms, nausea and vomiting could all be signs that an area of your heart is receiving inadequate blood flow. Symptoms of chest pain with exercise may or may not precede a heart attack. Sweating or left arm, shoulder or neck symptoms such as pain, numbness or tingling can also be symptoms of a heart attack. <b>If you think you may be having a heart attack, you should call 911 to receive emergency transportation to an emergency room.</b> An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) and blood tests can be performed to show whether your heart is the cause of your symptoms. Delaying medical care is very dangerous when a heart attack may be occurring.</p><p>Less dangerous causes of your symptoms are, of course, possible. It is common for acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease, also called GERD) to cause nausea in addition to chest pain.&#xA0;GERD can also cause shortness of breath. Less commonly, a bulge of the stomach above the level of the diaphragm (hiatal hernia) can cause nausea and chest pain or shortness of breath.</p>
