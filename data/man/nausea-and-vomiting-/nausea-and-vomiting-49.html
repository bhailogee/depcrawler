					<h1>Nausea and Vomiting</h1>
<p><b>Abdominal pain, fever, and nausea or vomiting can signify a dangerous infection in the abdomen. If your pain is substantial, you should seek medical attention today.</b></p><p>Pain in the midline of the abdomen can arise from inflammation anywhere in the intestine, from appendicitis, from an inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis), or from contamination of the abdominal space (called the &quot;peritoneal space&quot;) outside of the intestines. Contamination of this space causes irritation of the abdominal wall, known as &quot;peritonitis.&quot; Peritonitis most commonly results from a hole in the intestine, such as the hole that may develop if a stomach or intestinal ulcer erodes through the full thickness of the intestine wall.</p><p>A much less dangerous cause of your symptoms is certainly possible, such as a virus infection of the stomach and intestine which is called &quot;gastroenteritis.&quot;</p><p><b>If your symptoms are significant, it is best to have a doctor evaluate you to ensure you do not have one of the dangerous infections that may result in your symptoms.</b></p>
