					<h1>Nausea and Vomiting</h1>
<p>Some causes of nausea and vomiting also cause bleeding into the digestive tract. Blood in vomit can appear red or (due to a chemical change from stomach acid) dark and grainy, like coffee grounds. Deteriorated blood in the stool may be black and have a tar-like texture.</p><p><b>Have you vomited blood or &quot;coffee grounds,&quot; or have you noticed black tar-like stools?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nausea-and-vomiting-22.html">Yes, the look of my vomit or stools suggests bleeding.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nausea-and-vomiting-4.html">No, this does not apply to me.</a></p>
