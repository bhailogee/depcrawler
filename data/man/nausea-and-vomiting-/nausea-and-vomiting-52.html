					<h1>Nausea and Vomiting</h1>
<p><b>Your symptoms suggest a bacterial infection or emergency within your pelvis. Seek medical care today.</b></p><p>Several severe pelvic area infections may result in nausea or vomiting along with fever and pelvic or groin discomfort. These infections include an anal abscess, pelvic inflammatory disease (&quot;PID&quot;),&#xA0;and acute prostatitis. A less dangerous genital infection that can cause nausea and vomiting during its first episode of symptoms is the herpes virus.</p><p><b>Anal Abscess</b></p><p>An anal abscess is also known as a &quot;perianal abscess&quot; or a &quot;perirectal abscess.&quot; Injury or inflammation in the lining of the rectum may permit bacteria to contaminate one of the mucus glands that surround the rectum. The mucus glands are normal structures that help to lubricate your rectum. When they become infected, the infection may quickly intensify to create a pocket of pus. An anal abscess may cause pain with bowel movements or continuous pain. It commonly causes irritation of the nearby skin so it can create a red, tender or itchy patch of skin within an inch or two of the anus. Frequently, white or yellow pus can be seen through the center of this skin patch as the abscess prepares to drain pus. It is possible for an abscess in this area to make you dangerously ill. <b>An anal abscess requires drainage by your doctor or by a surgeon.</b></p><p><b>Pelvic Inflammatory Disease</b></p><p>Pelvic inflammatory disease, a bacterial infection of a woman&apos;s pelvic organs, may make her dangerously ill and, by scarring her fallopian tubes, can result in infertility. Gonorrhea and Chlamydia are the two bacteria types that are commonly responsible, and these are passed through sexual contact.</p><p><b>Acute Prostatitis</b></p><p>If you are a man and have symptoms of fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea or vomiting, then you may have acute prostatitis.&#xA0; Acute prostatitis is an infection of the prostate that develops suddenly and intensifies quickly, after contamination by bacteria from the gut or from sexual contact. Acute prostatitis sometimes causes a severe enough illness that it may require a hospital stay and intravenous antibiotics for treatment.</p><p><b>Herpes Infection</b></p><p>Herpes is a virus infection that is spread by sexual contact. It can cause a blistering and painful rash on the skin, or it may cause an open sore in the lining of the rectum (called a rectal ulcer). Swelling around a rectal ulcer can cause a sensation that your rectum will not completely empty, and can also cause you to pass mucus with or between your stools.</p>
