					<h1>Hair Loss in Men</h1>
					<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Welcome to our guide on hair loss in men.</p><p>Most men can expect some thinning or change in their hair pattern as they age. Usually hair loss is gradual, but sometimes it can occur in a sudden, dramatic, or otherwise abnormal way. This type of hair loss can sometimes signal an underlying condition or medical problem.</p><p>Hair loss may result in diffuse hair thinning or cause one or more areas of the scalp to become bald (the medical term for baldness is alopecia).</p><p>This guide is intended to help you figure out why you are losing hair and to point you in the right direction for evaluation and treatment. Please keep in mind that this information cannot replace a face-to-face evaluation with your own health care provider.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/hair-loss-in-men-2.html">Click here to begin.</a></p>
