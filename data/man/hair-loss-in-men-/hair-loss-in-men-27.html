					<h1>Hair Loss in Men</h1>
<p>Men who develop this pattern of hair loss usually have hereditary pattern baldness. This is also called male-pattern baldness or androgenetic alopecia.</p><p>As the name suggests, hereditary pattern baldness is an inherited condition (and not just from your mother&apos;s family, as is commonly believed). More than a third of men will experience this type of hair loss. Often, the first changes of hereditary-pattern baldness can be seen when men are in their 20s or 30s.</p><p>Certain medications can help to prevent or even reverse this type of hair loss. Minoxidil (Rogaine) shampoo is available over the counter, while the drug finasteride (Propecia) requires a doctor&apos;s prescription.</p>
