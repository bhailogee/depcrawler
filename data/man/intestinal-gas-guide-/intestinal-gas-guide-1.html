					<h1>Intestinal Gas Guide</h1>
					<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>If you have frequent burping or frequent passing of gas from your rectum, this guide can help you to understand where your gas comes from and how you can reduce it.</p><p>Burping (belching), a noisy stomach, or passing of gas from the lower bowel can be embarrassing events, but they are rarely caused by a medical problem. More often, gas is the result of the foods that you eat and how much air you swallow. If your gas symptoms are significant, or if you have other unexplained symptoms, it is best for you to <b>consult with your doctor.</b> This guide is intended to be used as a complement to discussions with your doctor, not as a substitute for office-based care.</p><p>You will encounter a small number of questions about your experience with gas as you proceed through this program. Your answers to these questions will help us to personalize our recommendations for you.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/intestinal-gas-guide-2.html">Click here to begin.</a></p>
