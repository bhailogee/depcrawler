<p>You have indicated that you have frequent small burps throughout the day, unrelated to your meals.</p><p>This pattern of burping usually occurs because of a habit of swallowing air during regular breathing or speaking, known as &quot;aerophagia.&quot; Most of the swallowed air may not even be making it into your stomach, collecting instead in the esophagus and bursting out during efforts to swallow or speak.</p><p>Although testing is usually unnecessary, an X-ray video (called a modified barium swallow) can demonstrate the swallowing and release of excess air. Most people with chronic air swallowing can eliminate the problem by identifying and resisting the habit to swallow air.</p><p>Additionally, you can reduce the amount of air that you swallow in the following ways:</p><ul><li><p>Avoid gum chewing.</p></li><li><p>Don&apos;t smoke.</p></li><li><p>Avoid carbonated beverages.</p></li><li><p>Take time to eat meals and resist gulping food or liquid.</p></li></ul><p>For some people, anxiety causes more pronounced air swallowing. If anxiety might be contributing to your problem, you should seek advice about stress reduction from a physician.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/intestinal-gas-guide-41.html">Continue</a></p>
