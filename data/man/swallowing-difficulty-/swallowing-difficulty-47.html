					<h1>Swallowing Difficulty</h1>
<p>It is possible for radiation to cause irritation and scarring of the esophagus, resulting in swallowing problems. Because you have had radiation treatments, you should see your doctor for an evaluation. </p><p></p><p>Tests that might be used to discover the cause of your swallowing problem include laryngoscopy (viewing of the larynx through your nose or mouth with a camera on a flexible, narrow rod) or a video swallowing study (this study uses an x-ray technique called fluoroscopy to videotape your swallowing while you consume samples of foods or drink containing a material that can show up on x-ray). </p>
