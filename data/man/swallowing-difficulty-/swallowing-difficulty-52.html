<p>Your symptoms or past history of  neurologic  (brain or nerve) problems could be related to your swallowing difficulty. You need to schedule a visit with your doctor to discuss your swallowing difficulty.  </p><p></p><p>Your doctor will strongly consider the possibility that your swallowing problem might come from a  neurologic  (brain or nerve) problem, or from a muscle disease.  </p><p></p><p>Your doctor will also closely review your medicines. Several medications (particularly medicines to treat psychiatric symptoms) can cause swallowing difficulty as a side effect because they may interfere with your mouth and throat muscle coordination. </p><p></p><p>Tests that might be recommended by your doctor include laryngoscopy (viewing of the larynx through your nose or mouth with a camera on a flexible, narrow rod), video swallowing study (this study uses an x-ray technique called fluoroscopy to videotape your swallowing while you consume samples of foods or drink containing a material that can show up on x-ray),  esophagogastroduodenoscopy, or  EGD  (viewing of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum with a camera on a flexible, narrow cord), barium swallow (x-ray views of the esophagus after you swallow a liquid that shows up on x-ray), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain, or antibody test (blood test) for the condition myasthenia gravis. </p>
