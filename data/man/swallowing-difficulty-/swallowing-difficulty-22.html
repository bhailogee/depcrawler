<p>Even with no noticeable symptoms of acid reflux, it is possible that you have acid injury in your esophagus. If you have had acid reflux for a long time, it can cause circular scarring at the bottom of the esophagus (a stricture.)  </p><p></p><p>You will need a test called  esophagogastroduodenoscopy, or  EGD  (viewing of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum with a camera on a flexible, narrow cord). If you have scarring that is narrowing your esophagus, you may need your doctor to stretch the scar during this procedure, a process called dilatation. If an abnormality is seen that is concerning for cancer, your doctor can take a biopsy sample to check for cancer. </p>
