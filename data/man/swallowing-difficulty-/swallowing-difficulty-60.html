					<h1>Swallowing Difficulty</h1>
<p>Your symptoms suggest you might have some acid reflux from the stomach, also called  gastroesophageal  reflux (GERD).  GERD  is treatable with anti-acid medicines. </p><p></p><p><b>Since you have had weight loss, contact your doctor to discuss your uncomfortable swallowing. </b> Rarely,  GERD  symptoms, weight loss, and a feeling of uncomfortable swallowing can be caused by a problem in the way that nerves trigger the muscle function of the esophagus. This problem is named  achalasia. If your doctor is concerned about your weight loss and other symptoms, an x-ray test named a barium swallow might be recommended for you, to provide more information about your swallowing difficulty. This test shows the shape of your esophagus during your swallows, so your doctor can know if your esophagus muscles are functioning correctly. </p>
