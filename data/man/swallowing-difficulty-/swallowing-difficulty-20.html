					<h1>Swallowing Difficulty</h1>
<p>Acid reflux (gastroesophageal  reflux) is still a very likely cause of your symptoms, even though you have not had noticeable heartburn or other classic symptoms of acid reflux.  </p><p></p><p>Another explanation for your swallowing difficulty could include a narrowing that is called an esophageal ring. Esophageal rings can occur without a clear reason. Sometimes they are associated with allergic inflammation in the esophagus called  eosinophilic   esophagitis, which might be related to food allergy. </p>
