					<h1>Swallowing Difficulty</h1>
<p>Usually, if a swelling or a blockage in the throat is what is interfering with swallowing, the swallowing trouble that occurs will only happen when you are eating solid food, not liquids. In your case, you are having difficulty with both solids and liquids. Since both solids and liquids are difficult to swallow, your swallowing problem may be coming from a change in the way your nerves and muscles are working within your throat to coordinate your swallow.  </p><p></p><p><b>Do you have a </b><b>neurologic</b><b> condition such as multiple sclerosis, or do you have double vision, difficulty walking, or a history of falling? </b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/swallowing-difficulty-52.html">Yes, one or more of those applies to me.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/swallowing-difficulty-49.html">No, none of those apply to me.</a></p>
