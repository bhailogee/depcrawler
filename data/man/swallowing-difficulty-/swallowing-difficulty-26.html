					<h1>Swallowing Difficulty</h1>
<p>The medicine you took can be irritating to the throat and esophagus if you don&apos;t swallow enough water to rinse your throat well when you take your pills. If your swallowing is caused by this problem, your condition is named pill  esophagitis. Consider this when you discuss your symptoms with your doctor. </p><p></p><p>Esophagitis  has several other common causes.  </p><p></p><p>Above all, acid reflux is the most common cause of  esophagitis. Acid reflux is also called  gastroesophageal  reflux disease (GERD). It is a  backflow  of digestive acid from the stomach. It causes a chemical irritation or &quot;burn&quot; of the esophagus.  </p><p></p><p>Infections in the esophagus also can cause  esophagitis, but this is much less common than  esophagitis  from acid reflux. Only a few types of infection are common in the esophagus, and they usually do not occur if your immune system is normal. If your immune system is weakened, you may develop  esophagitis  from yeast or from  cytomegalovirus  (CMV) or herpes virus.  Esophagitis  from infections can occur in people who have HIV infection, use steroid medicines for a long time, have had organ transplants, or have been treated with chemotherapy for cancer.  </p><p></p><p>Your doctor may recommend at test called   esophagogastroduodenoscopy, or  EGD  (viewing of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum with a camera on a flexible, narrow cord), to confirm that you have  esophagitis  and to identify the cause. </p>
