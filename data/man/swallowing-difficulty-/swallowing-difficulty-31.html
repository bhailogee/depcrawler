					<h1>Swallowing Difficulty</h1>
<p>The symptoms you just reviewed can be caused by acid reflux (also called  gastroesophageal  reflux, or GERD). Pain with swallowing or a persistent sore throat can also be symptoms of acid reflux. You may want to try using an over-the-counter anti-acid medication such as  famotidine  (Pepcid),  ranitidine  (Zantac), or  omeprazole  (Prilosec) to see if your symptoms decrease.  </p><p></p><p>Pain with swallowing can also come from a serious problem such as a bacterial infection (including strep throat), a yeast infection of the throat or, rarely, a cancer.  </p><p></p><p><b>If your symptoms persist more than one week, call your doctor&apos;s office for advice.</b></p><p></p><p><b>If you have a fever, if you have lost weight, or if you have a weak immune system (from HIV or another reason), call your doctor&apos;s office -- don&apos;t wait. Call now for advice and to arrange an appointment.</b></p>
