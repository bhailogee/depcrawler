<p>First, we&apos;d like to ask about symptoms related to the most common causes of hand tremors.</p><p><b>Does your tremor stop when you&apos;re at rest, increase in certain positions (such as with your arms and hands outstretched), and decrease when you try to use your hands?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/tremor-4.html">Yes, that sounds like me.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/tremor-3.html">No, that&apos;s not the trouble I have.</a></p>
