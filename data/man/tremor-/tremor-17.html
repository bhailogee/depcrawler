					<h1>Tremor</h1>
<p>Okay, great.</p><p>Now some questions about your thyroid. That&apos;s a gland that sits just in front of your lower neck. It makes a hormone called &quot;thyroid hormone,&quot; and when it makes too much (a condition called hyperthyroidism), tremors are common.</p><p>On the other hand, many people have an underactive thyroid (a condition called hypothyroidism). As a treatment for hypothyroidism, these people must take a replacement form of thyroid hormone. If their dose is too high, they can also have tremors.</p><p><b>So, here are 3 questions about your thyroid:</b></p><p>1. Do you take thyroid hormone?</p><p>2. Have you been told your thyroid is overactive (or that you have hyperthyroidism)?</p><p>3. Do you have any of the following symptoms (that could be due to hyperthyroidism)?</p><p>- Unexplained weight loss</p><p>- Heat intolerance</p><p>- Palpitations</p><p>- Insomnia</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/tremor-18.html">Yes, I have a thyroid condition or those symptoms.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/tremor-19.html">I&apos;d like to quit now.</a></p>
