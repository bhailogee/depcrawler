					<h1>Tremor</h1>
<p>Okay, good! Here&apos;s the next question.</p><p>Tremors may be caused by medications and other substances that stimulate the nervous system. Examples include:</p><p>- Certain medications for asthma, such as albuterol</p><p>- Pseudoephedrine, as found in many cold remedies</p><p>- Antipsychotic medications, such as chlorpromazine</p><p>- Caffeine</p><p>- Cocaine</p><p><b>Do you take any of these? Did you start taking a new medication just before your tremor began?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/tremor-16.html">Yes, I take one of these or I&apos;ve started a new medicine.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/tremor-14.html">No, I take none of those and no new medicines.</a></p>
