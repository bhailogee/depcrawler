					<h1>Tremor</h1>
<p>It&apos;s possible that the tremor is due to Parkinson&apos;s disease, especially if you have other associated symptoms, such as a decrease in dexterity or coordination; a tremor of the chin, lips or tongue; or an overall tendency not to move. The side-effects of antipsychotic medications can cause similar symptoms.</p><p>Of course, these symptoms can occur on their own or with other conditions. If you are concerned about the possibility of Parkinson&apos;s disease (or if you are taking an antipsychotic medication), <b>make an appointment with your doctor.</b></p><p><b>Would you like to quit now?
