					<h1>Tremor</h1>
<p>A tremor that gets worse when trying to do something is called an &quot;intention tremor.&quot; There are a variety of causes, including stroke, alcoholism, multiple sclerosis, over use of sedatives, and certain antiseizure medicines. The common link in these seems to be a problem in the cerebellum or its connections. This is a part of the brain involved in balance and fine coordination. If this is the type of tremor you have, make an appointment with your doctor. If the symptoms have been getting worse, your doctor may want to expedite your appointment.</p><p><b>Would you like to continue exploring causes of tremors?
