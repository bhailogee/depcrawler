<p>Okay. From your answers so far, you have Raynaud&apos;s and heartburn, but no red spots over the fingers, face or chest that become temporarily pale when pressed, no white flecks under the skin and no skin thickening. That&apos;s good, because it makes diseases such as scleroderma and CREST syndrome less likely.</p><p>It&apos;s important to understand that some of these symptoms are common even in people who are quite healthy and will remain so. In particular, Raynaud&apos;s and heartburn are common in the population and do not by themselves indicate the presence of any of these associated rheumatic conditions.</p><p>The only way to sort out whether your Raynaud&apos;s and heartburn are related to one another and whether they need treatment is to <b>see your physician</b> for evaluation.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/raynaud-s-24.html">Click here to finish the guide.</a></p>
