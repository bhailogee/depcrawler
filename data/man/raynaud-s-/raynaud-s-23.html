					<h1>Raynaud&apos;s</h1>
<p>Okay.</p><p>It sounds like you may have a condition called CREST syndrome, a form of scleroderma considered to be less severe -- in fact, it is often called the &quot;limited form&quot; of scleroderma.</p><p>The name, CREST, comes from the first letters of calcinosis (deposits of calcium under the skin), Raynaud&apos;s, esophageal dysfunction (including swallowing problems or severe heartburn), sclerodactyly and telangiectasia (small red spots on the skin that become temporarily pale when pressed). It is also possible you have diffuse scleroderma (a type that may affect different parts of the body, also called progressive systemic sclerosis), especially if there is skin thickening in places other than the fingers.</p><p>People with possible CREST syndrome or diffuse scleroderma should see a doctor for evaluation and treatment, so <b>contact your doctor</b> and let him or her know about these symptoms.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/raynaud-s-24.html">Click here to finish the guide.</a></p>
