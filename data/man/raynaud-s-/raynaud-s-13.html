					<h1>Raynaud&apos;s</h1>
<p>It&apos;s good you do not have pain in multiple joints because that makes diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis less likely (though some lupus patients do not have prominent joint pain).</p><p>The presence of any of the other symptoms mentioned earlier could help sort out whether you have a rheumatic disease to explain them all.</p><p>For example, if you also have skin thickening and heartburn, scleroderma or CREST becomes real possibilities. If you have a prominent rash and/or pain when you take a deep breath, lupus (also called SLE) becomes more important to consider.</p><p>It&apos;s important to understand that some of these symptoms are common even in people who are quite healthy and will remain so. In particular, Raynaud&apos;s and dry mouth are common in the population and do not by themselves indicate the presence of any of these associated rheumatic conditions.</p><p>The only way to sort out whether your symptoms are related to one another is to <b>see your physician</b> for evaluation.</p><p>Remember, most people with Raynaud&apos;s have no associated illness; for them, it is an annoyance but nothing serious.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/raynaud-s-24.html">Click here to finish the guide.</a></p>
