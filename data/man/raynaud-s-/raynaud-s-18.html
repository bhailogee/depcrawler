<p>Okay, so you have Raynaud&apos;s and pain in multiple joints. In that situation, especially if the hands and wrists are involved, or if there is joint swelling, you could have a single condition causing both Raynaud&apos;s and arthritis.</p><p>The next question is about other symptoms that might link your symptoms with a single arthritic disease.</p><p><b>Do you also have a chronic (longstanding) rash?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/raynaud-s-20.html">Yes, I also have a chronic rash.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/raynaud-s-19.html">No, I don&apos;t have a rash.</a></p>
