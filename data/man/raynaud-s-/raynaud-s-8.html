					<h1>Raynaud&apos;s</h1>
<p>Okay. From your answers, you have Raynaud&apos;s, heartburn and one or more skin symptoms that can be seen with scleroderma or CREST syndrome. This combination makes it important to <b>see your doctor</b> for evaluation, so that a diagnosis can be established and treatment, if needed, can be started.</p><p>If you have additional symptoms, other diagnoses should be considered.</p><p>For example, prominent dryness of the eyes and mouth would raise the possibility of Sjogren&apos;s syndrome; joint pain, rash and painful breathing would make lupus more likely.</p><p>This combination also raises the possibility of an &quot;overlap syndrome.&quot; For example, some people have a disease that combines features of Sjogren&apos;s syndrome, lupus, and scleroderma.</p><p>Finally, your symptoms could be coincidental. Each of these symptoms (especially heartburn and Raynaud&apos;s)&#xA0;is rather common in the population and might be unrelated.</p><p>Because you have several features of rheumatic disease (Raynaud&apos;s, heartburn and some skin symptoms), it is important to <b>see a physician</b> to have these symptoms evaluated further.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/raynaud-s-24.html">Click here to finish the guide.</a></p>
