					<h1>Raynaud&apos;s</h1>
<p>Okay so you have Raynaud&apos;s and a rash.</p><p>The details of your rash make a big difference in determining whether it may be related.</p><p>The rash of lupus tends to be worse with sun exposure, may be most prominent across the nose and cheeks, and may be circular and the size of a coin.</p><p>If you have this sort of rash and Raynaud&apos;s, lupus (also called systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE) is a rheumatic disease that could cause both.</p><p>On the other hand, many people have a rash that is unrelated. Skin disease that causes rash and Raynaud&apos;s are both common problems in the general population and they may be coincidental.</p><p><b>In addition to Raynaud&apos;s and rash, do you also have chronic (longstanding) pain in multiple joints?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/raynaud-s-17.html">Yes, I have joint pain with a rash.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/raynaud-s-16.html">No, I don&apos;t have pain in multiple joints.</a></p>
