					<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Raynaud&apos;s Decision Guide.</p><p>We&apos;re sorry to hear you have Raynaud&apos;s!</p><p>The goal of this guide is to provide information while awaiting evaluation with your doctor, or additional information after you have seen him or her. Please keep in mind that this guide is not intended to replace a face-to-face evaluation with your doctor. The diagnoses provided are among the most common that could explain your symptoms, but the list is not exhaustive and there are many other possibilities. In addition, more than one condition may be present at the same time. For example, a person with Raynaud&apos;s could also have osteoarthritis that is unrelated.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/raynaud-s-2.html">Click here to begin.</a></p>
