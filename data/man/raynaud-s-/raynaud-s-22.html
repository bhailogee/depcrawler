					<h1>Raynaud&apos;s</h1>
<p>Okay. So you have thickened skin with Raynaud&apos;s but no heartburn, white deposits under the skin or little red spots. It&apos;s possible you have sclerodactyly (thickened skin on the fingers that can develop in anyone with severe or longstanding Raynaud&apos;s) but if your skin thickening is NOT just limited to the fingers -- that is if it extends over the back of your hands, forearms or other areas of skin -- it is possible you have scleroderma (also called progressive systemic sclerosis, or PSS).</p><p>Anyone with these features of CREST or scleroderma should see a physician for evaluation, so <b>contact your doctor</b> about these symptoms.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/raynaud-s-24.html">Click here to finish the guide.</a></p>
