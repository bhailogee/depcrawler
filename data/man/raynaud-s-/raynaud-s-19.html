					<h1>Raynaud&apos;s</h1>
<p>Okay. From your answers, you have Raynaud&apos;s and joint pain, but no rash.</p><p>If the joint pain is worse in the morning and involves the hands and wrists, you could have arthritis due to a rheumatic disease that also causes Raynaud&apos;s. Examples include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</p><p>It&apos;s important to understand that some of these symptoms are common even in people who are quite healthy and will remain so. The only way to be sure about whether your arthritis and Raynaud&apos;s are connected to one another and whether you should be treated for either is to <b>see your physician</b> for evaluation.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/raynaud-s-24.html">Click here to finish the guide.</a></p>
