					<h1>Raynaud&apos;s</h1>
<p>Okay -- from your answers so far, you have Raynaud&apos;s and dry eyes and mouth (also called SICCA, from the Latin word for &quot;dry&quot;). This combination of symptoms raises the possibility of Sjogren&apos;s syndrome, a &quot;cousin&quot; of rheumatoid arthritis in which mouth and eye dryness are prominent.</p><p>If you also have salivary gland swelling -- the most obvious place is just beneath the ear and over the jaws -- Sjogren&apos;s syndrome becomes even more likely.</p><p>Just one more question:</p><p><b>Do you have chronic (longstanding) pain in multiple joints?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/raynaud-s-14.html">Yes I also have pain in multiple joints.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/raynaud-s-13.html">No, I don&apos;t have pain in multiple joints.</a></p>
