					<h1>Raynaud&apos;s</h1>
<p>Great! It is likely that you are one of the many people who have Raynaud&apos;s without a clear explanation, and who have no other associated rheumatic disease, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or scleroderma. Raynaud&apos;s is quite common, affecting up to ten percent of the population (especially women) and 90 percent of the time it occurs without these other diseases.</p><p>However,&#xA0;with severe pain, numbness, color change, wounds that are slow to heal, infections,&#xA0; scarring ,&#xA0;or if new symptoms, including those mentioned earlier, develop over time, it is important to be evaluated by your physician.</p><p>The questions asked earlier are meant to assess the possibility that your Raynaud&apos;s is due to an underlying rheumatic disease, such as</p><ul><li><p>systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, or just &quot;lupus&quot;), a condition in which there is often joint pain, a rash and/or pain with breathing</p></li><li><p>Sjogren&apos;s syndrome -- a disease marked by dry eyes and mouth and joint pain</p></li><li><p>scleroderm and CREST syndrome -- a condition in which there is usually some combination of skin thickening over the fingers, heartburn, and breathing problems</p></li><li><p>an &quot;overlap&quot; syndrome, in which there are features of several different disorders present at the same time.</p></li></ul><p>Doctors often order antibody tests, called the antinuclear antibody (ANA) and rheumatoid factor (RF), because these antibodies are associated with the conditions above. However, they don&apos;t usually help much if there are no other symptoms as in your case.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/raynaud-s-24.html">Click here to finish the guide.</a></p>
