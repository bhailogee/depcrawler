					<h1>Raynaud&apos;s</h1>
<p>Okay. From your answers so far, you have Raynaud&apos;s and chest pain with deep breaths, but no pain in multiple joints or chronic rash.</p><p>The presence of any of the other symptoms mentioned earlier could help sort out whether you have a rheumatic disease to explain them all.</p><p>For example, if you also have prominent dry eyes and dry mouth, Sjogren&apos;s syndrome becomes a consideration. If you have prominent heartburn and skin thickening, scleroderma or CREST syndrome become more likely. While pain in the chest can be a problem in persons with lupus, most lupus patients also have joint and/or skin disease.</p><p>It&apos;s important to know that some of these symptoms are common even in people who are quite healthy and will remain so. For example, Raynaud&apos;s and heartburn are common in the population and do not by themselves indicate the presence of any of these associated rheumatic conditions.</p><p>The only way to sort out whether your rash, Raynaud&apos;s and other symptoms are related to one another and whether they need treatment is to <b>see your physician</b> for evaluation.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/raynaud-s-24.html">Click here to finish the guide.</a></p>
