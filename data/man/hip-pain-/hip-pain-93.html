<p>Just to review: you&apos;ve indicated that you are at least 55 years old, have no other joint pain besides that in one or both hips and that the hip pain began suddenly.</p><p>Some people notice a painful area, like a bad bruise, over the outside of the hip. The next question --the last one!-- asks about that.</p><p><b>Can you reproduce the pain by pressing on one spot over the outside of the hip?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/hip-pain-95.html">Yes, I can bring on the pain by pressing.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/hip-pain-94.html">No, I cannot reproduce the pain by pressing.</a></p>
