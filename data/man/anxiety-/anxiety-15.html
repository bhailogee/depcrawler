<p>You may have panic disorder with agoraphobia.</p><p>In panic disorder, you have regular panic attacks. Panic attacks can be very disturbing. They include sudden bursts of fear, perhaps accompanied by apprehension or a sense of doom. You may have physical symptoms, such as sweating, dizziness, a rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing, a choking feeling or stomach discomfort. You may shake or tremble, feel out of control, feel unreal or feel like you are dying or going crazy.</p><p>Panic disorder sometimes goes with agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is the fear of any place where it might be difficult to escape -- like being in a theater or a crowded mall, traveling on a bus or an airplane. People with agoraphobia avoid such situations because they fear having a panic attack.</p><p>Fortunately this disorder is very treatable. The symptoms are usually reduced or eliminated by a combination of psychotherapy and medication.</p>
