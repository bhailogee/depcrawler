					<h1>Anxiety</h1>
<p>You may have an acute stress disorder.</p><p>A diagnosis of acute stress disorder is made if you have very recently experienced a traumatic event, you keep re-experiencing the trauma, and you avoid reminders of the trauma. Anxiety after trauma is normal. It generally is very helpful to rely upon friends and family for support. It is probably not a good idea to spend too much time reliving the trauma, because that can make you feel worse rather than better. Instead focus on trying to manage your symptoms and maintaining your functioning as much as you can.</p><p>But if symptoms last for many months or you can&apos;t get on with your life, you may find it helpful to seek treatment through your primary care provider or a mental health professional.</p>
