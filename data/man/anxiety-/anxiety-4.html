					<h1>Anxiety</h1>
<p>Some people never have typical panic attacks, but they&apos;re uncomfortable or anxious when in certain settings. They might always take stairs to avoid using an elevator or take a longer route to avoid driving through a tunnel.</p><p>The fear is not caused by having to perform or socialize.</p><p>Please tell us whether there are uncomfortable settings you avoid. (Anxiety about performance and being in social situations are addressed in separate questions.)</p><p><b>Even if you don&apos;t get severe anxiety attacks, are you afraid of getting stuck somewhere you can&apos;t escape. Do you avoid those situations because you fear becoming anxious (for example, being outside, in a crowd, on a bridge, bus, train or airplane)?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/anxiety-12.html">Yes, certain settings scare me and I avoid them.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/anxiety-5.html">No, I don&apos;t avoid specific settings.</a></p>
