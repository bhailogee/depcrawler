					<h1>Anxiety</h1>
<p>You may have performance anxiety.</p><p>Performance anxiety is specific to a particular activity, like public speaking, acting, or being in a musical performance. In a sense, it is a form of social anxiety. But sometimes the anxiety-provoking performance is relatively private, such as taking a test.</p><p>This anxiety may be a small issue if you are never required to do the activity you fear, but it can be devastating if it blocks your progress in life. A lawyer who can&apos;t appear in court or an executive who can&apos;t make a public presentation may find it hard to advance. An otherwise talented artist may never succeed if performance undermines the ability to play or act.</p><p>This type of anxiety is usually very treatable with either psychotherapy, a medication (sometimes taken just prior to a performance), or both.</p>
