					<h1>Jaw, Gum, or Tooth Pain</h1>
<p>A common explanation for a toothache that&apos;s felt in the jaw is gingivitis and other gum infections. Rarely, a bone or sinus infection causes jaw pain.</p><p>Another cause of a &quot;toothache&quot; that is actually from jaw trouble is temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome. This is a condition in which the TMJ is painful due to arthritis, a torn piece of cartilage, or other mechanical problems in the joint.</p><p>TMJ syndrome is especially likely if you have pain at the angle of the jaw (near the ear) with opening or closing of the jaw, a popping or clicking when you move your jaw, or if you grind your teeth when you sleep.</p><p><b>With your jaw pain, is there redness and/or swelling along the gum?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/jaw-gum-or-tooth-pain-16.html">Yes, there&apos;s redness or swelling along the gum.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/jaw-gum-or-tooth-pain-9.html">No, there&apos;s no redness or swelling along the gum.</a></p>
