Fortunately, this is usually an easy thing to treat. See your dentist soon for evaluation!</p><p>Just one more question:</p><p><b>Do you take a medication for osteoporosis or other bone disease, such as alendronate (Fosamax), risedronate (Actonel), ibandronate (Boniva), or the intravenous medication zoledronic acid (Zometa or Reclast)?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/jaw-gum-or-tooth-pain-25.html">Yes, I am taking one of those medicines.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/jaw-gum-or-tooth-pain-24.html">No, I&apos;m not taking one of those medicines.</a></p>
