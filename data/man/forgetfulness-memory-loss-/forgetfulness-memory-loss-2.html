					<h1>Forgetfulness Memory Loss</h1>
<p>It is normal to have some difficulty remembering names and summoning specific words as you get older. This may gradually worsen as you age, but it should not prevent you from getting around in your daily life. Normal memory loss does not affect a person&apos;s daily function. Abnormal or worrisome memory loss is different--it can affect daily function.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><b>Other than forgetting people&apos;s names, words for things, and where you left your keys, is your memory generally okay?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/forgetfulness-memory-loss-42.html">Yes, my memory is generally okay.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/forgetfulness-memory-loss-3.html">No, I am more forgetful than this.</a></p>
