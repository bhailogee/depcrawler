Of these, medications for anxiety, insomnia, and seizure disorders have the strongest links to forgetfulness and memory loss.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Sometimes, starting a higher dose of a medication that wasn&apos;t causing problems before can contribute to a memory problem.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Prescription medications aren&apos;t the only culprit. Over-the-counter medications, as well as herbs and other so-called dietary supplements, can also cause memory problems.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><b>Did you start a new medication or dietary supplement, or increase the dose of one you were already taking, at about the same time you experienced a change in memory?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/forgetfulness-memory-loss-15.html">Yes, I did.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/forgetfulness-memory-loss-14.html">No, neither applies to me.</a></p>
