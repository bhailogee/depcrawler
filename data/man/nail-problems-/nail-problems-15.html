<p>You could have a bacterial or fungal infection near the nail (called a paronychia). These occur most often in people who frequently have wet hands. Try soaking the finger, but <b>contact your physician,</b> especially if it is not getting better within a few days. If there is pus draining from the nail, redness spreading up the finger, fever or severe pain, <b>seek medical attention right away</b> ! Treatment may include a drainage procedure and antibiotics.</p><p><b>Would you like to learn more about this or other common causes of nail problems?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nail-problems-19.html">Yes, I&apos;d like to learn more!</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nail-problems-18.html">No, I&apos;m all set, ready to quit, thanks.</a></p>
