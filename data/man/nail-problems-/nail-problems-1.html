					<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Sorry to hear you have a problem with your nail(s).</p><p>Please keep in mind that this guide is not intended to replace a face-to-face evaluation with your doctor. The goal of this guide is to provide information while awaiting evaluation with your doctor or additional information after you have seen him or her.</p><p>Nail problems may develop for a number of reasons -- skin inflammation, an ingrown nail, and psoriasis are among the most common, but an infection is among the most serious. Any problem in the nail that does not improve over time should be evaluated by your physician.</p><p>At the end of this guide, you will be offered links to more detailed information about the most common nail problems; however, there are rare causes that will not be included here and would require more detailed evaluation than this guide can provide.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nail-problems-2.html">Click here to begin.</a></p>
