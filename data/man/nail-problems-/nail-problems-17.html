					<h1>Nail Problems</h1>
<p><b>You could have injured the finger or toe in a way that requires prompt evaluation. For example, if there is a dark purple, red or black area under the nail, you might have a &quot;subungual hematoma&quot; (meaning &quot;blood under the nail&quot;) which can be drained to provide relief. Another possibility is that you broke a bone in your finger or dislocated it. For significant pain in the fingernail or toenail that followed a direct injury, see your physician for evaluation, especially if the pain is not improving on its own.</b></p><p><b>Would you like to learn more about these or other common causes of nail problems?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nail-problems-19.html">Yes, I&apos;d like to learn more!</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nail-problems-18.html">No, I&apos;m all set, ready to quit, thanks.</a></p>
