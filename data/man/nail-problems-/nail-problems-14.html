<p>You could have an ingrown toenail. Try soaking the toe and trimming the nail back away from the skin. Use toenail clippers, not scissors, and cut the nail straight across so the nail is slightly longer than the toe (and not too short or curved). It might also help to change your shoes to something that provides more room in the &quot;toe box,&quot; that area of the shoe that is often narrow and crowds the toes. <b>Contact your physician</b> if your nail pain lasts more than a week or two, sooner if the pain is severe. When this is a chronic or recurring problem, your doctor may refer you to a Podiatrist for nail care.</p><p><b>Would you like to learn more about this or other common causes of nail problems?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nail-problems-19.html">Yes, I&apos;d like to learn more!</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nail-problems-18.html">No, I&apos;m all set, ready to quit, thanks.</a></p>
