					<h1>Nail Problems</h1>
<p>Your symptoms could indicate a fungal infection in the nail. This is a remarkably common condition and is caused by the same fungus that causes &quot;athlete&apos;s foot.&quot; The nails may peel, become brittle and be a source of embarrassment because they look so discolored. Some people elect not to take treatment for this because: prescription antibiotics may eliminate the fungus but you may need to take them for many months; side effects are a concern (including interactions with other drugs, liver injury, gastrointestinal problems) and some are expensive. On the other hand, fungal infections are generally harmless so treatment decisions should take this into account.</p><p>If your symptoms persist, <b>contact your physician.</b></p><p><b>Would you like to learn more about this or other common causes of nail problems?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nail-problems-19.html">Yes, I&apos;d like to learn more!</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nail-problems-18.html">No, I&apos;m all set, ready to quit, thanks.</a></p>
