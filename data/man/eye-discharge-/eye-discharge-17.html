					<h1>Eye Discharge</h1>
<p>From the description of your symptoms, you may have a sty. This is a small collection of pus, a tiny bacterial abscess,&#xA0;which forms near eyelashes in blocked oil glands. A sty will usually drain on its own within a few days, relieving symptoms. While waiting for this to happen, apply warm water to a clean washcloth and use this as a compress on the sty several times each day. Avoid the temptation to squeeze the sty. Once it drains, wash the eyelid frequently.</p><p>Some people get these repeatedly; a prescription eyedrop or ointment may be helpful to prevent recurrence.</p><p><b>Would you like more information about eye conditions that may cause a discharge?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/eye-discharge-22.html">Yes, I&apos;d like more information!</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/eye-discharge-21.html">No, I&apos;m all set, ready to quit!</a></p>
