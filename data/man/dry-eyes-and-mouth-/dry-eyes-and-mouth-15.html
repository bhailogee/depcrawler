					<h1>Dry Eyes and Mouth</h1>
<p>Okay. As a cause of mouth dryness, dehydration is among the most reversible; that is, it&apos;s often easy to fix: drink more fluids (unless you were instructed not to do so by your doctors). If you have an underlying medical condition that makes you prone to repeated or chronic dehydration -- such as diabetes or colitis with chronic diarrhea -- treatment of the underlying condition, rather than specific treatment of dry mouth, tends to help the most. <b>Talk to your doctor</b> about how you might better avoid dehydration.</p><p>One more question, this one is about the parotid gland, which is located just below the ear, in front of the jaw, and is one of the major salivary glands.</p><p><b>Have you ever had enlargement of the parotid gland?</b></p><p>It may have been called parotitis, or inflammation of the parotid gland.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/dry-eyes-and-mouth-18.html">Yes, but only on one side.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/dry-eyes-and-mouth-17.html">Yes, both salivary glands have been enlarged.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/dry-eyes-and-mouth-16.html">Nope, never had an enlarged salivary gland.</a></p>
