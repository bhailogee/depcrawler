					<h1>Persistent Knee Swelling</h1>
<p><b>Enlargement of the Bones</b></p><p>The most common form of arthritis is called osteoarthritis. It&apos;s sometimes called &quot;degenerative joint disease&quot; or &quot;wear and tear arthritis&quot; because it is associated with advancing age and with injury (although there are rarer causes, such as previous joint infection). In this condition, the shiny, smooth cartilage that normally lines our joints becomes thinned or fragmented; in response, the bone underneath the cartilage enlarges and this may look like knee swelling. Most people with osteoarthritis do not have much, if any, extra fluid in the joint; however, for reasons that are not entirely clear, some people not only have bony enlargement but also have extra fluid in the joint and that can contribute to knee swelling.</p><p><b>Would you like to continue reading more about causes of knee swelling (next up: swelling near the joint) or would you rather move on to some questions about your specific situation?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-knee-swelling-5.html">Swelling near the knee, without joint swelling</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-knee-swelling-7.html">Information specific to my situation</a></p>
