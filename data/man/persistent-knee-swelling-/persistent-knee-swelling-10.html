					<h1>Persistent Knee Swelling</h1>
<p>Okay -- since it&apos;s not worse in the morning, chronic inflammation is less likely -- so, you could have a type of arthritis that is relatively non-inflammatory (such as osteoarthritis), or your knee swelling could be unrelated to the joint. For example, bursitis or a skin infection could cause swelling around the knee without affecting the joint itself.</p><p>If you did describe persistent &quot;morning stiffness&quot; (worse pain or stiffness when you first get up lasting at least 30 minutes), an inflammatory joint disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis would be a real possibility, especially if you had multiple painful, swollen joints.</p><p>Now we&apos;ll move onto another question about the location of the swelling, because swelling on top of the knee cap can indicate bursitis rather than arthritis.</p><p><b>Do you have swelling confined to the kneecap (that is, just in front of the knee)?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-knee-swelling-13.html">Yes, the swelling is confined to the kneecap.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-knee-swelling-12.html">No. I have no swelling confined to the kneecap.</a></p>
