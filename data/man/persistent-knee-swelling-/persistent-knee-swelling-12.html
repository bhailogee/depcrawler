					<h1>Persistent Knee Swelling</h1>
<p>Okay. The reason for this question is that a form of bursitis (called pre-patellar bursitis) can cause knee pain and swelling yet the problem isn&apos;t in the joint at all. Since you don&apos;t have swelling there, it&apos;s less likely that you have that type of problem.</p><p><b>Do you have pain and/or swelling that is worse after walking or that is most prominent at night or at the end of the day?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-knee-swelling-15.html">Yes, it&apos;s worse after walking, at night or late in the day.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-knee-swelling-14.html">No, it&apos;s not worse after walking or toward the end of the day.</a></p>
