					<h1>Persistent Knee Swelling</h1>
<p>Okay, that&apos;s helpful information. Your answers suggest that your knee swelling may be due to osteoarthritis (the most common form of arthritis) or a related condition. Significant osteoarthritis or other types of arthritis in which there is little or no inflammation tend to cause more pain and/or swelling after use or at night. Another possibility is a torn piece of cartilage (called a torn meniscus) or a ligament injury, especially if there is locking of the knee or giving way.</p><p>We have just a few more questions!</p><p><b>Have you had problems with easy bruising or bleeding?
