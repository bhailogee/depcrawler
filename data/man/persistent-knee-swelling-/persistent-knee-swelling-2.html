					<h1>Persistent Knee Swelling</h1>
<p>In general, one or both knees may be swollen due to</p><ul><li><p>increased joint fluid</p></li><li><p>blood in the joint</p></li><li><p>enlargement of the bones near the knee joint</p></li><li><p>swelling near the knee joint (without an actual joint problem)--for example, bursitis can cause swelling directly on top of the kneecap</p></li><li><p>fluid behind the knee, called a Baker&apos;s cyst.</p></li></ul><p>Each of these will be briefly reviewed. There are other, rarer, causes that will not be covered here.</p><p>Let&apos;s start with <b>Increased Joint Fluid:</b></p><p>Normally, there is a tiny amount of fluid in the knee which serves as a lubricant and to deliver nutrition to the cartilage that lines the joint. When there is any type of arthritis present, fluid may accumulate in the joint. This is sometimes called &quot;water on the knee.&quot; In addition to arthritis, structural problems in the knee (such as torn cartilage or ligament injury) may stimulate extra fluid formation.</p><p>Your doctor may recommend a procedure (called arthrocentesis, or joint aspiration) in which a sample of fluid is removed from the knee and analyzed for the presence of white blood cells, red blood cells, infection, or crystals.</p><p>This is helpful because certain diseases can be suggested or even proven by the results of this analysis:</p><ul><li><p>high white blood cell count in joint fluid suggests the presence of marked inflammation (making infection a larger concern).</p></li><li><p>a&#xA0;large number of red blood cells suggests there&apos;s been bleeding into the joint.</p></li><li><p>many common bacterial joint infections can be identified by analysis of the fluid.</p></li><li><p>gout or pseudogout, the most common forms of &quot;crystal-induced&quot; arthritis, can be proven by seeing the appropriate crystal (uric acid crystals in gout; calcium crystals in pseudogout).</p></li></ul><p><b>Would you like to continue learning about other causes of joint swelling (next up: blood in the joint) or would you prefer to move on to questions about your particular situation?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-knee-swelling-3.html">Blood in the joint</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-knee-swelling-7.html">Information specific to my situation</a></p>
