					<h1>Persistent Knee Swelling</h1>
<p>Okay. The reason for this question is that people with bruising or bleeding problems may develop painful knee swelling due to bleeding into the joint. For example, if you have hemophilia or if you are taking a blood thinner (such as coumadin), you may be prone to episodes of hemarthrosis (bleeding into the joint). Your knee swelling could be related. The only way to know is to have further evaluation, possibly including removal of a sample of fluid for testing.</p><p>Your next question asks about symptoms other than in the knee that could provide an explanation for persistent knee swelling.</p><p><b>Are any of the following true about you or your knee swelling?</b></p><ul><li><p><b>My symptoms began after unprotected sex.</b></p></li><li><p><b>I have a previous history of a sexually transmitted disease, such as gonorrhea or chlamydia.</b></p></li><li><p><b>I have a previous history of infectious or bacterial diarrhea.</b></p></li><li><p><b>I live in an area where Lyme disease has been reported, I have previously had a large, circular rash, or symptoms began after a known tick bite.</b></p></li></ul><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-knee-swelling-19.html">Yes, one or more of those is true for me.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-knee-swelling-18.html">No, none of those is true for me.</a></p>
