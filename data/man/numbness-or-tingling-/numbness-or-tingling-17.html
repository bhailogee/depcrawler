					<h1>Numbness or Tingling</h1>
<p>Your symptoms raise the possibility that you have diabetes; this would be especially likely if you are overweight and/or have a family history of diabetes. When the blood sugar is high, increased urination is common. In addition, diabetes can damage nerves; those in the feet and lower legs are usually the first to be affected.</p><p>If you already know that you have diabetes, your symptoms of numbness or tingling could represent a complication; tighter blood sugar control might be a good idea.</p><p>There are many other possibilities besides diabetes, though most would not explain the urinary symptoms you have mentioned. Of course there could be more than one problem going on: maybe you have a urine infection causing frequent urination and an unrelated neuropathy.</p><p>The only way to sort this out quickly is to <b>contact your physician for evaluation.</b></p><p><b>Would you like to learn more about this and other common causes of tingling and/or numbness?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/numbness-or-tingling-27.html">No, I&apos;m all set, ready to quit.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/numbness-or-tingling-28.html">Yes, I&apos;d like to learn more!</a></p>
