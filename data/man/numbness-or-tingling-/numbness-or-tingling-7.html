<p>Good. That makes zoster (also called &quot;shingles&quot;) less likely, but if your burning or tingling sensation has only been going on a few days, a rash could develop in the area and that would make zoster quite likely.</p><p>Just a couple more questions:</p><p><b>Have you noticed numbness and/or tingling for at least three months?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/numbness-or-tingling-9.html">Yes, I have had this for at least three months.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/numbness-or-tingling-8.html">No, I have had this for less than three months.</a></p>
