					<h1>Numbness or Tingling</h1>
<p>Okay. If it were related to repetitive motion,&#xA0;carpal tunnel syndrome &#xA0;might be even more likely, but it&apos;s still a possible cause of hand numbness and tingling. Usually, it affects the thumb, second and&#xA0;third fingers, while sparing the&#xA0;fifth (little finger). It may be due to diabetes,&#xA0;hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid), pregnancy, or, often, no identifiable reason.</p><p>Another cause of hand numbness comes from the elbow - called ulnar neuropathy, it&apos;s often related to leaning on the elbow. It may feel like you&apos;ve bumped your &quot;funny bone.&quot;</p><p><b>Would you like to quit now or learn more about causes of numbness and tingling?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/numbness-or-tingling-28.html">Yes, I&apos;d like to learn more!</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/numbness-or-tingling-27.html">No, I&apos;m all set, ready to quit.</a></p>
