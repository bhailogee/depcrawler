					<h1>Numbness or Tingling</h1>
<p>These symptoms are typical of &quot;shingles,&quot; a nerve infection with herpes zoster. This condition only occurs in people who have previously had chicken pox (even if they don&apos;t remember it) because the nerve infection is actually a re-activation of the virus that was living near the nerve ever since the original chickenpox infection. If you do have&#xA0;shingles, there are medications that can help.</p><p>Another possibility is&#xA0;vasculitis, a rare set of diseases in which blood vessels become inflamed, and that can lead to nerve damage.</p><p><b>Contact your doctor for prompt evaluation</b>.</p><p><b>Would you like to learn more about this and other common causes of tingling and/or numbness?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/numbness-or-tingling-27.html">No, I&apos;m all set, ready to quit.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/numbness-or-tingling-28.html">Yes, I&apos;d like to learn more!</a></p>
