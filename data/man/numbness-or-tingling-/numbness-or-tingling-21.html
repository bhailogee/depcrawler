					<h1>Numbness or Tingling</h1>
<p>Your symptoms could be due to&#xA0;carpal tunnel syndrome, a condition in which a large nerve traveling through the wrist is compressed in a narrow tunnel of bones (called the carpal tunnel). Diabetes, pregnancy,&#xA0;an underactive thyroid and arthritis are among the most common causes for this. However, many people with carpal tunnel syndrome have no apparent cause or risk factor. <b>Contact your doctor</b> if the symptoms persist for more than two weeks.</p><p><b>Would you like to learn more about this and other common causes of tingling and/or numbness?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/numbness-or-tingling-27.html">No, I&apos;m all set, ready to quit.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/numbness-or-tingling-28.html">Yes, I&apos;d like to learn more!</a></p>
