					<h1>Numbness or Tingling</h1>
<p>Okay. So you&apos;ve had this numbness or tingling for at least three months, no one else in the family has it, there&apos;s no associated rash, it&apos;s not limited to the hands or arms, it&apos;s not in the feet, it does not seem related to position, it did not start after a major injury and you don&apos;t have paralysis, confusion, slurred speech or difficulty walking.</p><p>That&apos;s good! But because you have none of the more common symptoms that could help define the cause of your numbness and/or tingling, it is hard to know what may be causing it.</p><p>Sometimes these symptoms appear and disappear for no apparent reason, or they develop when people are breathing fast (as with exercise, anxiety or even on purpose), disappearing when the breathing returns to normal. You could have a particularly rare problem. Or, other features may develop over time that allow a particular diagnosis to be established. <b>Contact your doctor for further evaluation.</b></p><p><b>Would you like to learn more about common causes of tingling and/or numbness?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/numbness-or-tingling-27.html">No, I&apos;m all set, ready to quit.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/numbness-or-tingling-28.html">Yes, I&apos;d like to learn more!</a></p>
