					<h1>Treatment of Impotence</h1>
<p>So far, you&apos;ve indicated that you cannot use, didn&apos;t respond to, didn&apos;t like using, or were not interested in using the following treatments</p><ul><li><p>PDE5 drugs such as Viagra, Levitra or Cialis</p></li><li><p>injections</p></li><li><p>suppositories</p></li><li><p>vacuum pumps.</p></li></ul><p>You have tried the common options available and have indicated that none of them have worked well enough. It might be helpful to try a combination of these approaches if you haven&apos;t tried that already.</p><p>Another possible treatment to consider is surgery. In most men, surgery involves insertion of a mechanical or inflatable prosthesis. This prosthesis is used to make the penis firm when you want to have sex. The prosthesis is then readjusted or deflated after sex is completed. In a small number of younger men, surgery can be performed that actually cures the cause of their impotence.</p>
