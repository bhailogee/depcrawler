<p>Suppositories are tiny pellets that are inserted into the tip of the penis (urethra). These pellets contain medication that causes blood to flow into the penis and make it firm. Suppositories work in some men who don&apos;t respond to other treatments.</p><p>Many men are squeamish about inserting anything into the tip of their penis, even though the suppositories are easier to use and less uncomfortable than they may seem. Suppositories can cause mild discomfort, and more rarely, prolonged and uncomfortable erections (priapism).</p><p><b>Have you tried suppositories?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-impotence-35.html">Yes, I have tried suppositories.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-impotence-32.html">No, I have not tried suppositories.</a></p>
