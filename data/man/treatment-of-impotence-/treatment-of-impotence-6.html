Drugs in this family include sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra).</p><p>PDE5 drugs are widely used for several reasons</p><ul><li><p>They are effective for many men, regardless of why a man has developed impotence.</p></li><li><p>They come as pills, and are therefore easy to use.</p></li><li><p>They are generally safe, and in most men, cause few side effects.</p></li></ul><p>Let&apos;s start by finding out whether you have tried any of the PDE5 drugs, such as Viagra, Levitra or Cialis.
