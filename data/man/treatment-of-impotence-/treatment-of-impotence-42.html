<p>So far, you&apos;ve indicated that you cannot use, didn&apos;t respond to, didn&apos;t like using, or were not interested in using the following treatments</p><ul><li><p>PDE5 drugs such as Viagra, Levitra or Cialis</p></li><li><p>injections</p></li><li><p>suppositories</p></li><li><p>vacuum pumps.</p></li></ul><p>Another possible treatment to consider is surgery. In most men, surgery involves insertion of a mechanical or inflatable prosthesis. This prosthesis is used to make the penis firm when you want to have sex. The prosthesis is then readjusted or deflated after sex is completed. In a small number of younger men, surgery can be performed that actually cures the cause of their impotence.</p><p>Keep in mind that all surgery involves risks, including the risk of serious infections, bleeding, or other types of permanent damage.</p><p>If you have tried all the other options for treating impotence and want to consider surgery, you should consult a urologist (surgeon who specializes in the urinary and the male reproductive system) who has expertise in this type of procedure.</p>
