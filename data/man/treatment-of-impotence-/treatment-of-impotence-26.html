<p>Injections require a man to use a tiny needle to inject drugs directly into the shaft of the penis. These drugs cause blood to flow into the penis and make it firm. Injections are one of the most effective treatments for impotence -- up to 90 percent of men will show a response.</p><p>Many men are squeamish about using needles on this delicate part of their anatomy, even though the injections are easier and less painful than they may seem. Injections can also cause long-term scarring, and more rarely, prolonged and uncomfortable erections (priapism).</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-impotence-28.html">I would be willing to try injections.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-impotence-27.html">No, I am not interested in trying injections.</a></p>
