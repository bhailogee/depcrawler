It is common for people to develop diarrhea when they include carbohydrates in their diet that are difficult to digest. One carbohydrate, lactose (milk sugar), can become more difficult to digest as you grow older.</p><p><b>Is your diarrhea most active after a meal that is heavy in cream, milk, cheese, or other dairy products?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/diarrhea-11.html">Yes, milk or dairy products sometimes trigger my symptoms.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/diarrhea-9.html">I have not noticed this, or I have eliminated milk from my diet.</a></p>
