					<h1>Diarrhea</h1>
<p><b>Since you have reported bleeding or fever along with your diarrhea, you may have inflammation within your bowel. You need an urgent evaluation by your doctor.</b></p><p>Inflammation in the bowel can result from medications that irritate the intestine lining, from an infection, from a cancer, or from an autoimmune problem (an attack by your own immune system).</p><p>If your symptoms have been persistent or recurrent, an autoimmune cause may fit well as an explanation. Diarrhea can result if your immune system attacks your own bowel, a problem called &quot;inflammatory bowel disease.&quot; Most inflammatory bowel disease is eventually identified as one of two conditions: &quot;Crohn&apos;s disease&quot; or &quot;ulcerative colitis.&quot;</p><p>Inflammatory bowel disease is more likely to fit as an explanation for your diarrhea if you are a young adult, although older adults can develop inflammatory bowel disease as well.</p><p>You should have a thorough evaluation of your bowel, including a camera-guided inspection of your colon that can check for cancer and for inflammation.</p>
