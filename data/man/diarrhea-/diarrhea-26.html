<p><b>You may have a parasite infection, so you need to be evaluated by a doctor.</b></p><p>Many cases of &#xA0;&quot;traveler&apos;s diarrhea&quot; resolve on their own. These cases are typically caused by a mild bacterial infection or by a virus.</p><p>Traveler&apos;s diarrhea can also result from parasite infections, especially infections with <i>amoebas</i> or <i>giardia.</i> Because of your recent travel or impure water exposure, your stool should be examined for parasite eggs and parasites. This evaluation is called an &quot;ova and parasite&quot; examination. Parasite infections can be treated with selected antibiotics.</p><p>Your doctor is likely to request a stool sample when you arrive, so it may be useful for you to collect a sample at home that could be used for testing. Stool can be examined by a medical laboratory to see if it contains inflammatory cells (fecal leukocytes) that are evidence of pus in the stool. Chemical tests can identify the presence of blood in the stool.</p><p>Your stool sample can also be tested for specific bacteria infections that are a cause of diarrhea, including <i>salmonella</i>, <i>shigella</i>, <i>campylobacter</i>, and aggressive strains of <i>e. coli.</i></p>
