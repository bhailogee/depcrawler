					<h1>Diarrhea</h1>
<p>One infection that causes diarrhea can arise when a harmful bacteria proliferates in the colon. This bacterium, named <i>clostridium difficile,</i> is normally present in small amounts in the colon but never as a large collection.</p><p>&quot;<i>C. diff.&quot;</i> bacteria commonly grow and multiply after antibiotic treatment has killed and cleared away some harmless bacteria types in the colon. Many commonly used antibiotics leave <i>C. difficile</i> living even though they kill other bacteria types in the colon. If <i>C. diff.</i> becomes the dominant bacteria type in the colon, it can cause inflammation and symptoms.</p><p><b>Have you been treated with antibiotics at any time in the past six weeks?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/diarrhea-25.html">Yes, I have recently been treated with antibiotics.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/diarrhea-20.html">No, I have not been treated with antibiotics.</a></p>
