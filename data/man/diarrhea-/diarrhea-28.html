					<h1>Diarrhea</h1>
<p>Because your diarrhea contains blood or pus, your symptom is named dysentery. Dysentery may be accompanied by abdominal pain or fever, and it is usually caused by a bacterial infection that requires urgent treatment. <b>Contact your doctor to schedule an urgent appointment.</b> Delay in treatment can put you at risk for complications, such as colon rupture or abscess formation.</p><p>Your doctor is likely to request a stool sample when you arrive, so it may be useful for you to collect a sample at home that could be used for testing. Stool can be examined by a medical laboratory to see if it contains inflammatory cells (fecal leukocytes) that are evidence of pus in the stool. Chemical tests can confirm the presence of blood in the stool.</p><p>Your stool sample can also be tested for specific infections that are a cause of dysentery, including <i>salmonella</i>, <i>shigella</i>, <i>campylobacter</i>, and aggressive strains of <i>e. coli</i>.</p><p>If you have traveled recently you may have a parasite infection as the cause of your dysentery, <i>amebiasis</i>. Infection with amoebas can also be acquired by living in a crowded institution where hygiene is not optimal, or by having a sexual encounter that includes mouth to anus contact.</p>
