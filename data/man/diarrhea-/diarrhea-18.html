<p>Some of the most serious infections that can result in diarrhea are less likely in your case, since you do not have blood or pus in the stool. Nonetheless, an infection is still the most likely cause of your acute diarrhea. Knowledge about recent food exposures that could have been contaminated with bacteria or parasites can be helpful.</p><p><b>Have you recently traveled to an underdeveloped country, or have you consumed water that may not have been pure while camping or recreating out of doors?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/diarrhea-26.html">Yes, I recently ate abroad or drank impure water.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/diarrhea-19.html">No, I have not had these exposures.</a></p>
