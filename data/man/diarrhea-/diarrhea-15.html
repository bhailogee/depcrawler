<p>You may be digesting your food inadequately, a medical problem that is termed &quot;malabsorption.&quot; Malabsorption is a serious problem because it prevents you from getting adequate nutrition. <b>Symptoms that suggest malabsorption require an evaluation by your physician.</b></p><p>Several medical problems can cause malabsorption. Examples of problems that can cause malabsorption are infection with the parasite &quot;<i>giardia</i>,&quot; excessive accumulation of bowel bacteria (bacterial &quot;overgrowth&quot;), damage to the pancreas (pancreatitis), and intestine injury due to long-term inflammation.</p><p>One cause of intestine injury and inflammation is sensitivity to grains in the diet. This causes &quot;gluten sensitivity,&quot; also known as &quot;celiac sprue.&quot; Celiac sprue only results in individuals who have a sensitivity to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, oats, barley, rye, and many food additives. This sensitivity causes an autoimmune reaction (an immune system attack) after gluten-containing foods are consumed. Blood tests are available to check for antibodies that can diagnose gluten sensitivity.</p>
