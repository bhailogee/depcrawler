					<h1>Diarrhea</h1>
<p>Most people who have diarrhea have a healthy and functioning intestine lining, despite their symptoms. A healthy intestine can efficiently absorb the nutrients in your food. If you are maintaining your weight and if you efficiently digest fats in your diet (leaving no fat or grease residue in your stools), then this is good evidence that your intestine lining is healthy.</p><p><b>Have you lost weight without explanation, or have you developed greasy or oily stools that have an exaggerated odor?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/diarrhea-15.html">Yes, I have lost weight or noticed these stool changes.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/diarrhea-8.html">No, I do not have these symptoms.</a></p>
