					<h1>Diarrhea</h1>
<p>Your diarrhea might be a complication of your antibiotic treatment. You should <b>contact your doctor</b> for an evaluation</p><p>Because you have recently been treated with antibiotics, your doctor may consider infection with <i>clostridium difficile</i> bacteria to be likely. This infection can develop because <i>C. diff.</i> is unaffected by some common antibiotics, but other competing bacteria types in the colon may be eliminated, clearing room for <i>C. diff.</i> to grow. This infection can be confirmed with stool testing and requires treatment with a specific antibiotic that is active against this bacteria type.</p><p>Your doctor is likely to request a stool sample when you arrive, so it may be useful for you to collect a sample at home that could be used for testing. Stool can be examined by a medical laboratory to see if it contains inflammatory cells (fecal leukocytes) that are evidence of pus in the stool. Chemical tests can confirm the presence of blood in the stool.</p><p>Your stool sample can also be tested for infections caused by food contamination, including <i>salmonella</i>, <i>shigella</i>, <i>campylobacter</i>, and aggressive strains of <i>e. coli</i>.</p>
