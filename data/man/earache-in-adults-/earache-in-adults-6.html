<p>So far your answers suggest that you do not have an ear infection. Sometimes pain in the ear will be caused by irritation of a nerve or by a problem that is not actually in the ear.</p><p>A problem with your jaw, teeth or gums can have pain that is felt in the ear. This is called referred pain.</p><p>If you notice more pain when you widely open your mouth or you chew, the problem may be in the temperomandibular joint (TMJ). You may also hear or feel clicking just in front of the ear.</p><p><b>Do you think you may have a problem with your jaw, teeth or gums?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/earache-in-adults-10.html">Yes, this sounds like my problem.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/earache-in-adults-7.html">No, my teeth, gums and jaw are fine.</a></p>
