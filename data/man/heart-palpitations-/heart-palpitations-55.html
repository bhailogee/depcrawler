					<h1>Heart Palpitations</h1>
<p>Now let&apos;s find out your heart rate. You will need a watch or clock with a second hand. Keep your fingertips on your pulse and count the number of beats you feel in 15 seconds, then multiply this by 4. This is your heart rate, the number of beats per minute. If you can&apos;t do this yourself, then ask a family member or friend to do this for you.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><b>What is your heart rate?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/heart-palpitations-64.html">My heart rate is 50 or less.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/heart-palpitations-63.html">My heart rate is between 51 and 100.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/heart-palpitations-62.html">My heart rate is between 100 and 130.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/heart-palpitations-61.html">My heart rate is greater than 130.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/heart-palpitations-56.html">No way for me to take my pulse.</a></p>
