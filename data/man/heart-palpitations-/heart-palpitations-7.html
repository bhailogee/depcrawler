					<h1>Heart Palpitations</h1>
<p>Use the tips of your index and middle finger to lightly push on the underside of your wrist below your thumb or on the side of your neck (about 1/2 inch from your windpipe), which ever is more comfortable for you. Now you can find out your heart rate. You will need a watch or clock with a second hand. Keep your fingertips on your pulse and count the number of beats you feel in 15 seconds, then multiply this by 4. This is your heart rate, the number of beats per minute.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Even though you don&apos;t have palpitations now, please continue with the guide. There is still a lot you can learn now about the palpitations you have had before.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><b>When the palpitations did occur in the past, how would describe your heart beat?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/heart-palpitations-13.html">I think my heart rate was regular, like clockwork.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/heart-palpitations-10.html">It was skipping or jumping around.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/heart-palpitations-9.html">Not sure.</a></p>
