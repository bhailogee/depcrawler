					<h1>Heart Palpitations</h1>
<p>Once you locate your pulse, you will need a watch or clock with a second hand. Keep your hand on your pulse and count the number of beats you feel in 15 seconds, then multiply this by 4. This is your heart rate, the number of beats per minute.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>If you can&apos;t do this yourself, then ask a family member or friend to do this for you.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><b>What is your heart rate?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/heart-palpitations-55.html">My pulse feels regular, like clockwork.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/heart-palpitations-36.html">My pulse is skipping or jumping around.</a></p>
