					<h1>Heart Palpitations</h1>
<p><b>No rush, but you should let your doctor know about those symptoms. Call your doctor for advice.</b></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>The most common cause of a rapid heartbeat is sinus tachycardia &#x2014; defined as a regular heart beat at a rate greater than 100 beats per minute.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Sinus tachycardia is a normal response to exercise, feeling anxious, fever, dehydration, and many other circumstances. The heart is actually doing what it is supposed to do.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Other causes of a fast regular heart beat include certain types of arrhythmias. Because you have had other symptoms with your palpitations, you doctor will want to investigate whether you could be having an arrhythmia.</p><p>&#xA0;</p>
