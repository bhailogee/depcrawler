					<h1>Swollen Glands in the Neck</h1>
<p>Infection of the skin on the scalp, face or neck can cause the lymph nodes to swell. When the infection is caused by bacteria, it is known as cellulitis. Usually the redness, swelling and discomfort of cellulitis&#xA0;are more noticeable than the lymph node swelling.</p><p>The rash of shingles (herpes zoster infection) can look like cellulitis in the early stages. Herpes zoster is a virus that can be treated with an antiviral medication. For treatment to be effective, the&#xA0;medication needs to be started soon after the rash appears.</p><p><b>Do you think you have a skin infection?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/swollen-glands-in-the-neck-15.html">Yes, I may have a skin infection.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/swollen-glands-in-the-neck-14.html">No, my skin does not appear infected.</a></p>
