					<h1>Coughs and Colds</h1>
<p>Your sore throat may be caused by a&#xA0;virus, a bacterial infection, a yeast infection, or irritants (such as refluxed stomach acid). Most of the time, a sore throat does not require a doctor&apos;s evaluation. If you have symptoms that come from a common cold, then you probably do not need to visit your doctor unless you would like to receive your own doctor&apos;s advice about over-the-counter treatment options.</p><p><b>Do you also have a runny nose, stuffy nose, or sneezing?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/coughs-and-colds-23.html">Yes, this describes my symptoms.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/coughs-and-colds-16.html">No, just my throat is sore.</a></p>
