					<h1>Coughs and Colds</h1>
<p><b>It would be prudent for you to visit with your doctor</b> because you may have &quot;strep throat.&quot; Strep throat (an infection with streptococcal bacteria) can become complicated if it is not treated. Without adequate antibiotic treatment, it is possible for strep throat to change into a peritonsillar abscess (a pocket of pus in the throat) or to result in the medical illness &quot;rheumatic fever.&quot;</p><p>If you are not found to have strep throat or if your symptoms persist for longer than a couple of weeks, you may want to talk with your doctor about other infections that can cause a sore throat. Several viral illnesses that persist for much longer than the common cold can cause throat pain with fever or lymph node swelling, such as infectious mononucleosis.</p>
