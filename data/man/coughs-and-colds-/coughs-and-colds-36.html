					<h1>Coughs and Colds</h1>
<p>Your most likely diagnosis is acute viral bronchitis. Antibiotic prescriptions are not recommended for&#xA0;acute bronchitis.</p><p>You do not have any obvious reason to need a doctor&apos;s evaluation for your symptoms. Most bronchitis infections improve within a week, and the cough is usually much improved by the tenth day after symptoms began. If you have a cough that persists for longer than several weeks, it would be a good idea to visit your doctor so that your diagnosis can be confirmed.</p><p>If your cough becomes more bothersome so that over-the-counter remedies do not provide you with sufficient comfort, your doctor may recommend a prescription medicine. These medicines include inhalers (such as albuterol), cough syrups that contain a narcotic, or the swallowed anesthetic medicine benzonatate (Tessalon, Tessalon Perles).</p>
