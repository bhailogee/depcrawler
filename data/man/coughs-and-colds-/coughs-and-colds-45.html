					<h1>Coughs and Colds</h1>
<p>Your heart history or your leg swelling makes it important for you to have a careful examination of your heart and circulation during any episode of cough or breathing symptoms.&#xA0;Heart failure is dangerous when it is not treated adequately.</p><p>New symptoms of leg swelling can also be caused by a blood clot in a deep vein of the leg. Breathing symptoms that occur at the same time as leg swelling from a clot can indicate that a portion of the blood clot has dislodged and traveled into the lung circulation. This life-threatening condition is called a &quot;pulmonary embolus.&quot;</p><p><b>Please schedule an urgent appointment with your doctor.</b></p>
