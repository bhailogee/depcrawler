					<h1>Coughs and Colds</h1>
<p>You probably have a virus other than influenza. Since you are bothered by your cough, you may find some relief from medications. Some medicines are available over-the-counter, including guaifenisin (Robitussin, Hytuss, Guiatus, Mucinex), dextromethorphan (Delsym, Benylin, Vick&apos;s, products that are named with the initials &quot;DM,&quot;) and throat lozenges. Of the active medicinal ingredients that are available over-the-counter, dextromethorphan and its brand name versions are the most effective.</p><p><b>Please note, some medicines have drug interactions with dextromethorphan. Drug interactions can make it unsafe to use medicines with this active ingredient. In particular, many anti-depressant medicines overlap with this medicine in possible side effects and should not be combined with dextromethorphan (&quot;DM&quot;).</b></p><p><b>Is your cough severe even after you use over-the-counter medicines? A cough that is severe may result in vomiting after you cough or may awaken you during the night.</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/coughs-and-colds-37.html">Yes, it is severe.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/coughs-and-colds-36.html">No, my cough is controlled well enough.</a></p>
