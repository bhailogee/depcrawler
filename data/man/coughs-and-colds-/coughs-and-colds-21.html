					<h1>Coughs and Colds</h1>
<p>You have told us that you have a sore throat along with at least one symptom (fever or lymph node enlargement) that suggests that your immune system is strongly activated against an infection.</p><p>It is possible that you have a virus that is not a threatening infection. However, your symptoms also fit well with &quot;strep throat.&quot; Strep throat is an infection with streptococcal bacteria. It is important for you to be evaluated by your doctor in case you have strep throat, because this infection can become complicated if it is not treated. It is possible for strep throat to change into a&#xA0;peritonsillar abscess &#xA0;(a pocket of pus in the throat) or to result in the medical illness &quot;rheumatic fever&quot; if you do not receive adequate antibiotic treatment.</p><p>If you are not found to have strep throat or if your symptoms persist for longer than a couple of weeks, you may want to talk with your doctor about other infections that can cause a sore throat. Several viral illnesses that persist for much longer than the common cold can cause throat pain with fever or lymph node swelling, such as&#xA0;infectious mononucleosis.&#xA0;</p><p>Please arrange a visit with your doctor to have your symptoms evaluated.</p>
