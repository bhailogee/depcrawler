					<h1>Coughs and Colds</h1>
<p>Your hoarse or lost voice is probably caused by a viral infection. Alternatively, if you have shouted, screamed, or talked more than usual recently, your hoarse voice may be from vocal cord muscle fatigue. Both of these problems clear up on their own. Unless your symptoms persist, you probably do not need to visit with your doctor. While your voice remains hoarse, try to minimize your efforts to speak. Whispering is fatiguing for your vocal cords and should also be avoided until you are recovered.</p><p>Click&#xA0;here for information on laryngitis.</p>
