					<h1>Coughs and Colds</h1>
<p>Your sore throat and nasal symptoms have lasted longer than the duration of a usual common cold. It is possible that you have a viral infection, but it is also possible that something other than an infection is causing your symptoms. The most common non-infectious cause of a runny, stuffy, or sneezing nose is allergy. When allergy causes these symptoms, you have the diagnosis,&#xA0;&quot;allergic rhinitis.&quot; Nasal secretions can trickle down your throat as &quot;post-nasal drip.&quot; Post-nasal drip commonly causes a persistent sore throat that may be especially noticeable in the morning.</p><p>For some people, allergic rhinitis is triggered by specific pollens in the air. When this is the case, symptoms can be more dramatic in spring or summer seasons. Because it has environmental triggers, allergic rhinitis is commonly called &quot;hay fever.&quot; This name can cause confusion, because it is not common for fever to accompany allergy symptoms.</p><p>You may benefit from discussing your symptoms with your doctor, so that advice about allergy triggers in your environment and advice about allergy treatment can be provided. Over-the-counter antihistamine medicines can be helpful, although they cause drowsiness in some people. Prescription medications are also available that might reduce your symptoms.</p><p>If your symptoms are getting worse or persist, contact your doctor&apos;s office.</p>
