<p>Whenever you have a cough or breathing symptoms, a problem with your heart function and circulation needs to be considered. Congestive heart failure occurs when your heart can&apos;t pump your blood forward effectively. It is typical for your lungs or your legs to become congested with fluid when your heart is not pumping efficiently.</p><p><b>Do you have any history of heart failure, or do you have new or worsened swelling in your legs?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/coughs-and-colds-45.html">Yes</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/coughs-and-colds-31.html">No</a></p>
