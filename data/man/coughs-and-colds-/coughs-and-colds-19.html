					<h1>Coughs and Colds</h1>
<p>Your sore throat and nasal symptoms have lasted longer than the duration of a usual common cold. It is possible that you have a&#xA0;viral infection, but it is also possible that something other than an infection is causing your symptoms. The most common non-infectious cause of a sore throat (in the absence of a runny nose, which you do not report having) is irritation from refluxed stomach acid (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or &quot;GERD&quot;). GERD can usually be managed with over-the-counter anti-acid medicine. It is reasonable for you to meet with your doctor to see if this diagnosis fits well with your symptoms and to discuss a treatment strategy.</p><p>If you have any medical conditions that result in an abnormal immune system (for example,&#xA0;HIV), if you take steroid pills (for example, prednisone), or if you use steroid sprays or inhalers, then you may have a yeast infection in your throat. A yeast infection in the throat is also known as &quot;thrush.&quot; Yeast infections in the throat are usually caused by a type of yeast called &quot;candida.&quot; <b>A visit to your doctor is recommended.</b></p>
