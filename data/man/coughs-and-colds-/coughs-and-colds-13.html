					<h1>Coughs and Colds</h1>
<p>Your symptoms are most likely caused by a viral infection (viral rhinitis, the &quot;common cold&quot;). Unless your symptoms persist, it is probably not necessary for you to visit your doctor for an evaluation. Over-the-counter cold medicines that include a decongestant or an antihistamine medicine may be helpful. If you have a health condition such as heart disease or high blood pressure, discuss the safety of over-the-counter cold medicines with your doctor prior to using them.</p><p>You should be on the watch for symptoms that would suggest you have developed a bacterial infection in one of your sinuses (&quot;acute sinusitis&quot;). When the interior of the nose is inflamed by a virus, your sinuses may not drain well. This can allow a bacterial infection to develop, causing pus to collect in one of your sinuses.</p><p>If your illness persists for <b>more than one week</b><i>,</i> symptoms that would suggest a bacterial sinus infection include</p><ul><li><p>headache</p></li><li><p>fever</p></li><li><p>pus (murky or opaque fluid that is yellow, green, or brown) in the nose instead of clear mucus</p></li><li><p>a toothache in your upper set of teeth</p></li><li><p>tenderness of your face around the sinus areas (brow, nose, and cheeks)</p></li><li><p>a lump (that could be an enlarged lymph node) in your neck or near your ear.</p></li></ul><p>One or more of these symptoms would make it advisable for you to visit with your doctor, if you continue to have symptoms for a total of longer than one week.</p>
