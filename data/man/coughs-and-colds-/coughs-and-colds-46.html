					<h1>Coughs and Colds</h1>
<p><b>Your chest pain is a symptom that should be evaluated by a doctor right away. Pain in the chest that occurs with breathing can be a sign of pneumonia or it can be a sign of a blood clot in the lung circulation. Pain in the chest that is constant can arise from heart disease. You may require antibiotics or other treatment.</b></p><p>Your doctor is likely to recommend that you have a chest x-ray to evaluate your lungs if you have pain with breathing.&#xA0;Pneumonia, a common cause of chest pain, can be diagnosed with a chest x-ray. Inflammation or fluid beneath a lung (called &quot;pleurisy&quot; or &quot;pleural effusion,&quot; respectively) can also result in pain and can be diagnosed by an x-ray. A common cause of a pleural effusion is a blood clot in the lung circulation, a condition called &quot;pulmonary embolus.&quot; If your doctor is concerned that your chest pain may be coming from your heart or from a pulmonary embolus, then an electrocardiogram (&quot;ECG,&quot; also called &quot;EKG&quot;) may be a useful test as well. The diagnosis of a pulmonary embolus can be confirmed by a computed tomography scan (CT scan) of the chest to view the blood vessels.</p>
