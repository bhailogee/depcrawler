					<h1>Coughs and Colds</h1>
<p>Since your sore throat is not associated with a fever, enlarged lymph nodes, or a white film or spots on your throat, you probably do not have &quot;strep throat.&quot; Your sore throat is much more likely to be caused by a&#xA0;virus. It is probably not a threatening infection. Unless you are having other symptoms that raise your concern, you do not need to visit your doctor unless you would like to receive your own doctor&apos;s advice about over-the-counter treatment options.</p><p>Antibiotics are unlikely to be of benefit. You may find relief from over-the-counter throat lozenges containing soothing ingredients such as menthol or camphor. Pain medicines such as Tylenol, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or naproxen sodium (Aleve) are excellent treatments for a sore throat.</p>
