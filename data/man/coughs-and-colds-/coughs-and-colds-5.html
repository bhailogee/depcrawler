					<h1>Coughs and Colds</h1>
<p>Your ear pain is likely to be from an infection in the canal that leads from your visible ear toward your ear drum. This canal commonly develops irritation and infection when it is exposed to continuous moisture, so infections in this area are sometimes called &quot;swimmer&apos;s ear.&quot; The medical term for an ear canal infection is &quot;otitis externa.&quot;</p><p>It is also possible that your ear pain is coming from an infection in the middle ear (&quot;otitis media&quot;).</p><p><b>It is advisable for you to visit with your doctor to have your ear pain evaluated.</b> Ear infections require treatment with antibiotics.</p>
