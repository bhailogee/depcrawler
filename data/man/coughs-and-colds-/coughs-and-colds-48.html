					<h1>Coughs and Colds</h1>
<p><b>Because you are coughing up blood, there is a possibility that you have a serious lung condition such as a cancer. You need to see a doctor so that you can be examined and an x-ray can be obtained. If you are short of breath or if you have coughed up more than several tablespoons of blood, you should proceed to an emergency medical facility.</b></p><p>The most common illness that causes a person to cough up blood is acute bronchitis. This is an infection that is usually caused by a virus, and it is not dangerous in most people. However, a&#xA0;cancer in the lung is also a possible explanation and a chest x-ray should be obtained. Some people who cough up blood require additional tests, such as a computed tomography scan (CT scan) or the procedure, &quot;bronchoscopy.&quot; Bronchoscopy involves maneuvering a camera at the end of a narrow flexible instrument into the interior of your airways, so they may be examined.</p>
