The most common cause of obstruction is a stone (much like a kidney stone, or gallstone), but there are other possibilities. An infection -- usually bacterial -- can also cause swelling on one side, and bacteria can complicate an obstruction.</p><p>Swelling in one parotid gland is a reason to <b>see your doctor sooner than later;</b> understanding the cause is critical so that you can get prompt, appropriate treatment.</p><p>Just one more question:</p><p><b>Do you have heart, kidney, or liver failure?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/dry-mouth-and-excessive-thirst-22.html">Yes, I have heart, kidney, or liver failure.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/dry-mouth-and-excessive-thirst-21.html">No, I don&apos;t have any of those.</a></p>
