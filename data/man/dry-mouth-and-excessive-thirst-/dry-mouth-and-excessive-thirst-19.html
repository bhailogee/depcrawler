					<h1>Dry Mouth and Excessive Thirst</h1>
<p>Okay. Dry mouth with parotid swelling on both sides can be seen with:</p><p>- Viral infections, such as mumps</p><p>- Sjogren&apos;s syndrome, an autoimmune condition marked by dry eyes, dry mouth, arthritis, lung problems, and abnormal antibodies in the blood</p><p>- Sarcoidosis, a condition that usually causes enlarged lymph nodes in the chest (which can easily be seen on a chest x-ray) and can sometimes cause parotid enlargement</p><p>- Amyloidosis, in which an abnormal protein deposits in tissues throughout the body</p><p>- High blood triglyceride levels, one of the blood lipids that is part of a full cholesterol panel</p><p>- Alcohol abuse</p><p>- Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia; recurrent self-induced vomiting can lead to parotid enlargement, though dry mouth is not a common symptom in this situation</p><p><b>Talk to your doctor about the swelling you&apos;ve had in your salivary glands and about these possible causes.</b></p><p>Just one more question:</p><p><b>Do you have heart, kidney, or liver failure?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/dry-mouth-and-excessive-thirst-22.html">Yes, I have heart, kidney, or liver failure.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/dry-mouth-and-excessive-thirst-21.html">No, I don&apos;t have any of those.</a></p>
