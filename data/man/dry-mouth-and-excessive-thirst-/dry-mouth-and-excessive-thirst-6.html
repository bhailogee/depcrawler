					<h1>Dry Mouth and Excessive Thirst</h1>
<p>If you have dry mouth and also have dry eyes, you could have a disease called Sjogren&apos;s syndrome. The next question asks about features of this disease that could make it more likely in your case.</p><p><b>In addition to the dry eyes and dry mouth, do you have one or more of the following?</b></p><p><b>- Swelling in the parotid gland(s) -- these are salivary glands located on the sides of the face, just below and in front of the ears (we&apos;ll return to this later in the guide).</b></p><p><b>- Abnormalities on specialized tests of tear or saliva production performed by your doctors, usually an eye doctor or ear-nose-and-throat doctor. (If you aren&apos;t sure if you&apos;ve had any of these checked, just ask your doctors!). These tests include the</b><b>Schirmer&apos;s</b><b>test, Rose-Bengal staining, basal and stimulated salivary flow, or lip biopsy.</b></p><p><b>- Positive (abnormal) antibody in the blood, called anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), especially with one type of ANA called</b><b>anti-Ro</b><b>. Again, if you aren&apos;t sure whether this has been checked, ask your doctor.</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/dry-mouth-and-excessive-thirst-8.html">Yes, one or more apply to me.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/dry-mouth-and-excessive-thirst-7.html">No, none of those are true for me.</a></p>
