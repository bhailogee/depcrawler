<p>Well, many medicines can cause dryness of the mouth or thirst as a side effect.</p><p>Don&apos;t stop taking medications you were prescribed, even if you think your medication could be causing your symptoms. <b>Check with your doctor</b> and talk about whether an alternative medicine (or even no medicine) is a reasonable option. And keep in mind that over-the-counter medicines, such as cold remedies, can cause dryness of the mouth as well.</p><p><b>Do you have diabetes?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/dry-mouth-and-excessive-thirst-15.html">Yes, I do have diabetes.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/dry-mouth-and-excessive-thirst-14.html">No, I don&apos;t have diabetes.</a></p>
