<p>Okay. As a cause of mouth dryness, dehydration is among the most common AND the most reversible. That is, it&apos;s often easy to fix. Drink more fluids (unless you were instructed not to do so by your doctors).</p><p>If you have an underlying medical condition that makes you prone to repeated or chronic dehydration -- such as diabetes or colitis with chronic diarrhea -- treatment of the underlying condition, rather than specific treatment of dry mouth, tends to help the most. <b>Talk to your doctor</b> about how you might better avoid dehydration.</p><p>Okay, we&apos;re nearly done. This next question is about the parotid gland. It&apos;s located just below the ear, in front of the jaw, and is one of the major salivary glands.</p><p><b>Have you ever had enlargement of the parotid gland?</b> It may have been called parotitis, or inflammation of the parotid gland.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/dry-mouth-and-excessive-thirst-20.html">Yes, but only on one side.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/dry-mouth-and-excessive-thirst-19.html">Yes, both salivary glands have been enlarged.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/dry-mouth-and-excessive-thirst-18.html">Nope, never had an enlarged salivary gland.</a></p>
