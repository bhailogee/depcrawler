Some combination of these or another arthritic disease is also possible.</p><p>Tendonitis, bursitis, or a muscle strain are possible, but would not explain pain in your other joints.</p><p>While over-the-counter pain medicines, rest and ice may be helpful, it is important that you <b>see a physician</b> to evaluate these symptoms (unless they are improving on their own).</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/shoulder-pain-204.html">Click here for more information.</a></p>
