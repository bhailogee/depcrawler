					<h1>Acid Reflux Treatment</h1>
<p><b>You may be a slow responder.</b></p><p>You have reported a short length of treatment. This is a shorter time than you might require to experience relief.</p><p>All acid-reducing agents in the Step 3 group have the potential to become progressively more effective over the first two months of use. The amount of time that it takes for a person to gain relief from symptoms is variable from one person to another. Only slightly more than ten percent of people will gain symptom-free success by the end of the first week of treatment. After the first eight weeks of treatment, most people with reflux have complete symptom relief.</p><p>At this time, we would recommend that you stick with your medicine. You should give it a full eight weeks to show results.</p><p><b>What would you like to do next?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/acid-reflux-treatment-29.html">Other reasons my Step 3 drug may not be working</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/acid-reflux-treatment-39.html">Thanks, I am ready to exit the GERD Treatment Guide.</a></p>
