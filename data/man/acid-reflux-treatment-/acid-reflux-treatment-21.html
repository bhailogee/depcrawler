These medicines work quickly and wear off within two or three hours. Examples include Tums, Rolaids, Maalox, Mylanta, and others.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/acid-reflux-treatment-35.html">Please click here to continue.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/acid-reflux-treatment-39.html">Thanks, I am ready to exit the GERD Treatment Guide.</a></p>
