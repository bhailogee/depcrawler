<p><b>Surgery Below the Diaphragm (Creation of&#xA0;a Stomach &quot;Cuff&quot;)</b></p><p>It is possible to use the minimally invasive surgical technique, laparoscopy, to overlap a portion of the upper stomach by folding it upon itself. This overlap creates a &quot;cuff&quot; of stomach tissue immediately beneath the lower esophageal sphincter. This is an effective way to correct a hiatal hernia, and it can help individuals with weak lower esophageal sphincter mechanisms as well. The most common surgery used for this purpose is named a &quot;Nissen fundoplication.&quot;</p><p>For most people who have this surgery, the operation can give the same amount of symptom relief that anti-acid medicines can provide. However, the surgery is not always successful at relieving symptoms for individuals who can&apos;t get relief from anti-acid medicines. Following surgery, about one out of five people will have at least one lasting bothersome side effect. These potential side effects include swallowing difficulty, diarrhea, or the inability to belch or vomit to relieve bloating or nausea.</p><p>When you continue, you will receive information about endoscopy treatments for GERD.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/acid-reflux-treatment-38.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
