<p><b>Endoscopy Treatments</b></p><p>Three new treatments, each developed to tighten the lower esophageal sphincter, can be performed with the use of an endoscope. An endoscope is a flexible tube that can be passed through the mouth and throat, to examine the interior of the esophagus with a built-in camera.</p><p><b>Esophageal stitching (&quot;Plication&quot;)</b></p><p>Using a tool at the end of the endoscope, permanent stitches can be used to bunch up esophagus tissue, narrowing the opening between the esophagus and stomach.</p><p><b>Radiofrequency heating (the &quot;Stretta&quot; procedure)</b></p><p>Heating the lower esophageal sphincter by beaming surges of energy through this area of the esophagus causes the sphincter to tighten. Researchers think tightening occurs because heat causes collagen deposits within the sphincter to permanently contract.</p><p><b>Injection of bulking material</b></p><p>A spongy, solid material forms after it is injected in liquid form. The product most commonly used for injection (&quot;Enteryx&quot;) results in a more bulky sphincter and decreases reflux.</p><p>All endoscopic treatments have been very recently developed, so we still have much to learn about their long-term success rates and complications.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/acid-reflux-treatment-39.html">Thanks, I am ready to exit the GERD Treatment Guide.</a></p>
