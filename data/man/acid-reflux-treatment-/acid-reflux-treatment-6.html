					<h1>Acid Reflux Causes</h1>
<p>These lifestyle adjustments can greatly improve symptoms and may help you to avoid dependence on antacid medicines:</p><ol><li><p><b>Avoid smoking.</b> Smoking loosens the lower esophageal sphincter and it also decreases saliva production, so the esophagus is less thoroughly rinsed.</p></li><li><p><b>Avoid alcohol.</b> Alcohol reliably loosens the lower esophageal sphincter, worsening reflux.</p></li><li><p><b>Avoid fatty foods, peppermint, chocolate, and caffeine.</b> These foods all loosen the lower esophageal sphincter.</p></li><li><p><b>Avoid carbonated beverages.</b> These increase burping frequency and promote reflux episodes.</p></li><li><p><b>Eat small, slow, and frequent meals.</b> Contents in a distended stomach are more likely to back-flow into the esophagus. Also, hurried eating or drinking can cause you to have increased gas due to swallowed air.</p></li><li><p><b>When heartburn is active, limit foods that are acidic or irritating.</b> Tomatoes, citrus fruits, or spicy foods can further irritate your esophagus if it is already feeling &quot;raw.&quot;</p></li><li><p><b>Eat your evening meal well ahead of your bedtime.</b> Lying down right after eating can promote more severe reflux.</p></li><li><p><b>Angle up the head of your bed.</b> You should raise your head six inches above your foot level with either a rigid foam wedge beneath the mattress or wooden blocks beneath the legs at the head of the bed.</p></li><li><p><b>Keep up adequate saliva production.</b> It may be helpful to use lozenges or chew gum in order to increase the rinsing of your esophagus. You should also drink plenty of fluids.</p></li><li><p><b>Lose weight if you are obese.</b> Extra abdominal mass increases the pressure that pushes against the lower esophageal sphincter, limiting its chances of staying closed.</p></li></ol><p><b>When you continue, we will discuss medicines that worsen reflux and medicines that help.</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/acid-reflux-treatment-7.html">Click here to continue: Medicines</a></p>
