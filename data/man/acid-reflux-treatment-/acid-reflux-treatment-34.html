<p><b>Motility Medicines</b></p><p>Another alternative for treating reflux is a medicine that encourages faster emptying of the stomach.</p><p>The most commonly used &quot;motility&quot; medicine today is metoclopramide (Reglan). This medication may be used in place of acid-blocker agents, or it may be used in combination with them.</p><p>Motility medication is equally effective at controlling reflux symptoms compared with an H2 blocker (Step 2) drug. Prolonged continuous use of metoclopramide is undesirable because of side effects that can begin after long-term use.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/acid-reflux-treatment-35.html">Please click here to continue.</a></p>
