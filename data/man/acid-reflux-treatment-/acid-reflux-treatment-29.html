<p>Are you taking a Step 2 drug and a Step 3 drug at the same time?</p><p>Adding these drugs together is not better than using one drug alone. In fact, Step 3 drugs (proton pump inhibitors) do not work as well if they are used in combination with a Step 2 drug (H2 blocker).</p><p>If you are taking both drugs together, stop the Step 2 drug so your Step 3 drug can work better.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/acid-reflux-treatment-30.html">What else can increase my benefit from a Step 3 drug?</a></p>
