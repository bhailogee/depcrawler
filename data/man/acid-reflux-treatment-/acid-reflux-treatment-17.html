					<h1>Acid Reflux Treatment</h1>
<p>You have chosen &quot;step-down&quot; drug treatment for GERD. This is an excellent choice.</p><p>For step-down treatment, you will start your treatment with one of the most potent medicines for GERD.</p><p><b>Step 3: Drugs for&#xA0;GERD</b></p><p><b>Acid blockers of high potency</b></p><p>Medications called &quot;Proton pump inhibitors&quot; are able to powerfully reduce the quantity of acid that the stomach produces, especially when they are taken in high doses. Examples include omeprazole (Prilosec OTC, Prilosec, or generic omeprazole), esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), pantoprazole (Protonix), and rabeprazole (Aciphex).</p><p>Some Step 3 medicines are available over-the-counter and others are available by prescription. They prevent symptoms, so they are ideal for people who have daily or persistent symptoms. They work too gradually to be used for as-needed treatment. These medicines can take up to two months to have their full benefit, although most people get relief more quickly.</p><p>Use Step 3 drugs either daily or twice daily depending on your need. If you have good relief of your symptoms on Step 3 drugs, or if you assume that you will, you may want to review less intensive treatments.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/acid-reflux-treatment-19.html">Step me down to view a less intensive treatment!</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/acid-reflux-treatment-18.html">Less potent drugs don&apos;t work for me, but Step 3 drugs do help.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/acid-reflux-treatment-25.html">Are there any more steps?
