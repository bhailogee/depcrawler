					<h1>Acid Reflux Treatment</h1>
<p>Many people take their antacid medicines at bedtime, because symptoms of GERD can be active at night. This is not always the best strategy, however.</p><p><b>You may be a &quot;morning person.&quot;</b></p><p>Although nighttime symptoms are common because you are lying down, your most active acid production occurs in the morning, particularly at the time of a morning meal. Most potent anti-acids have their peak effect within the first few hours after you take them. You might have a stronger effect from your medicine if you take your pill one hour or two before your breakfast.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/acid-reflux-treatment-34.html">Please show me one final drug treatment that can help reflux.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/acid-reflux-treatment-39.html">Thanks, I am ready to exit the GERD Treatment Guide.</a></p>
