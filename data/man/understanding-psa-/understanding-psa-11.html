					<h1>Understanding PSA</h1>
<p>Your PSA level is moderately elevated. More than half of men whose PSA level is ten or above will be found to have prostate cancer if a biopsy is performed.</p><p>However, not all men with an elevated PSA level have prostate cancer. Instead, the PSA level can rise for another reason, such as</p><ul><li><p>benign growth of the prostate gland (also known as BPH or benign prostate hypertrophy)</p></li><li><p>a prostate infection or urinary tract infection</p></li><li><p>damage to the prostate caused by a surgery or trauma.</p></li></ul><p>Therefore, if your PSA level is above ten , the first thing to find out is whether you may have had any of the following within the past two months:</p><ul><li><p>a prostate or bladder infection</p></li><li><p>urinary symptoms such as burning with urination, dribbling, hesitancy, or pain in the groin</p></li><li><p>prostate or bladder surgery</p></li><li><p>a bladder catheter used to drain urine while you are in the hospital or during minor surgery</p></li><li><p>trauma to the groin, for example, a major car or industrial accident.</p></li></ul><p><b>Have you experienced any of these conditions?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/understanding-psa-13.html">Yes, I have.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/understanding-psa-12.html">No, I have not.</a></p>
