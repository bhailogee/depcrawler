					<h1>Understanding PSA</h1>
<p>Most doctors recommend waiting until age 50 to start PSA testing. That&apos;s because prostate cancer is uncommon before this age. However, PSA levels are sometimes checked in men&#xA0;younger than age 50 because they have a risk factor for prostate cancer, such as having a close family member with the disease or being African-American (African American men are more likely than other men to develop prostate cancer and can develop an aggressive form of the disease at a young age).</p><p>Next, we need to know your most recent PSA test result. Usually this is a number between one and ten (PSA is measured in nanograms per milliliter, or ng/ml).</p><p><b>What was your PSA level?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/understanding-psa-25.html">Less than 1.0</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/understanding-psa-24.html">1.0 to 2.49</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/understanding-psa-23.html">2.5 to 3.99</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/understanding-psa-14.html">4.0 to 9.99</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/understanding-psa-11.html">10 or higher</a></p>
