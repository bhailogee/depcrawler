					<h1>Understanding PSA</h1>
<p>Your PSA level may be falsely elevated. This means that although your PSA level is above normal, there is a good chance that you do not have prostate cancer.</p><p><b>Contact your doctor.</b> You may need antibiotic treatment if you have evidence of a urinary tract infection or prostatitis. You should also talk to your doctor about repeating your PSA test in 1-2 months. If your repeat PSA level returns to normal (less than four), this is excellent news. If your PSA test remains elevated, further evaluation and a referral to a urologist is probably needed.</p><p>Click here if you would like to learn more about PSA testing.</p><p>Click here if you would like to learn more about prostate cancer.</p>
