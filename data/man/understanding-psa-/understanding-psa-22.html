					<h1>Understanding PSA</h1>
<p>Your PSA level may be falsely elevated. This means that although your PSA level is above normal, there is a good chance that you do not have prostate cancer.</p><p><b>Contact your doctor.</b> You may need antibiotic treatment if you have evidence of a urinary tract infection or prostatitis. You should also talk to your doctor about repeating your PSA test in 1-2 months. If your repeat PSA level returns to normal (less than four), this is excellent news. If your PSA test remains elevated, further evaluation is probably needed. Your options include</p><ul><li><p>referral to a urologist (prostate specialist)</p></li><li><p>measuring your &quot;free&quot; PSA level. This special way of testing your PSA level may help to decide if a prostate&#xA0;biopsy &#xA0;is needed. High levels of free PSA are reassuring, while low levels are worrisome for cancer.</p></li></ul><p>Click here if you would like to learn more about PSA testing.</p><p>Click here if you would like to learn more about prostate cancer.</p>
