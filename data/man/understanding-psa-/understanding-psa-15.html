					<h1>Understanding PSA</h1>
<p>PSA levels can also go up for other reasons. For example, riding a bicycle can put pressure on the prostate and cause a temporary spike in your PSA level. The same is true for ejaculation during sex or masturbation. In general, these activities cause PSA levels to rise only a little, and the PSA should return to normal within several days.</p><p><b>Did you ride a bicycle, have sexual intercourse or ejaculate in the 48 hours before blood was drawn for your PSA test?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/understanding-psa-21.html">Yes, I did.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/understanding-psa-16.html">No, I did not.</a></p>
