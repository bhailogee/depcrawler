					<h1>Understanding PSA</h1>
<p>The next thing to determine is how fast your PSA levels has been rising. You can figure this out if your PSA was checked within the past year or so. You should subtract your last PSA result from your current results. For example, if your PSA was 4.5 last year and is 5.0 this year, it has increased by 0.5 points (ng/ml) over the past year. A quickly rising PSA is worrisome, while a slowly rising PSA (or PSA level that goes down) is reassuring.</p><p><b>Has your PSA level been checked within the past year?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/understanding-psa-18.html">Yes, my PSA level was checked within the past year.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/understanding-psa-17.html">No, my PSA level was not checked within the past year.</a></p>
