The pain should improve over time.</p><p>To decrease pain, rest the elbow and avoid overuse, particularly those activities that might have triggered your pain in the first place. Over-the-counter pain medications, topical medications (such as IcyHot or BenGay) or the application of ice may be helpful.</p><p>If symptoms are getting worse or do not go away, <b>consult your physician.</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/elbow-pain-171.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
