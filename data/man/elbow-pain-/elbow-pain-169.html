<p>Based upon your answers, your elbow pain could be due to tendonitis or a sprain, and it may improve on its own over time.</p><p>To decrease pain, rest the elbow and avoid those activities that may have triggered the pain. An &quot;air splint&quot; or brace may be helpful. Over-the-counter pain medications, topical treatments (such as IcyHot or BenGay) or the application of ice may also provide some relief.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/elbow-pain-171.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
