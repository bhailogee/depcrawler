Swelling itself from any cause, even if just a fluid build-up, can be uncomfortable.</p><p>The location of the painful lump makes a big difference regarding the possible causes. In general, lumps that are part of the testicle itself require more careful attention from your doctor than lumps in other parts of the scrotum or groin.</p><p><b>Is the painful lump part of the testicle itself, or is the lump somewhere else in the scrotum or groin?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/lumps-or-pain-within-the-scrotum-27.html">Yes, the painful lump seems to be part of the testicle.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/lumps-or-pain-within-the-scrotum-25.html">No, the lump and pain are not coming from the testicle.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/lumps-or-pain-within-the-scrotum-20.html">I&apos;m not sure whether the painful lump is coming from the testicle.</a></p>
