A hernia is an opening in the lowest part of the abdominal wall can occur that allows intestine or other abdominal structures to push through into the groin or scrotum. There is often a swelling felt in the top part of the scrotum, near the groin. Your doctor should be able to make a diagnosis by examining you. Sometimes, another test such as an ultrasound or a CT scan may be necessary.</p><p>The discomfort may not actually be coming from the groin. Possibilities include</p><ul><li><p>a hydrocele - a benign collection of fluid within the scrotum, often related to a defect or irritation of the lining in the scrotum or spermatic cord. However, you will almost always see the swelling and if there is any discomfort, it is mild.</p></li><li><p>a varicocele - a dilated vein within the scrotum. They are common, occurring in about 15 percent of all men. A varicocele is much more likely to be felt on the left side of the scrotum compared to the right side.
