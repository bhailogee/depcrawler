					<h1>Blacking Out, Fainting, or Loss of Consciousness</h1>
<p>Some people are prone to getting lightheaded, especially people who have fainted in the past. Doctors call simple fainting spells vasodepressor syncope.</p><p>Normally when blood pressure starts to fall our heart rate speeds up to compensate. During a simple faint, blood pressure falls and heart rate does the opposite of what it should -- it slows down. If you are standing, not enough blood gets pumped to the brain.</p><p><b>Have you had fainting or near fainting spells in the past?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/blacking-out-fainting-or-loss-of-consciousness-31.html">Yes I have.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/blacking-out-fainting-or-loss-of-consciousness-30.html">No, this hasn&apos;t happened to me.</a></p>
