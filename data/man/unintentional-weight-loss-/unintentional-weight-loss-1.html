					<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Welcome to our Decision Guide on Unintentional Weight Loss.</p><p>This guide is designed to provide insight as to why you are losing weight without purposefully trying to diet. The guide should be used as a complement to the care you receive from a health professional. It is not intended to replace direct interaction with your doctor.</p><p>Doctors become most concerned about unintentional weight loss if it reaches more than five percent of the usual body weight (about ten pounds), especially if your weight has not stabilized and continues to go down.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/unintentional-weight-loss-2.html">Click here to begin.</a></p>
