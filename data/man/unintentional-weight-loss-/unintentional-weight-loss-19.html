					<h1>Unintentional Weight Loss</h1>
<p>Another possible cause of weight loss with a good appetite is malabsorption. This is a problem in the digestive system that interferes with the ability of nutrients to get from the intestine into the blood. People with malabsorption often have diarrhea, but not always. Celiac disease is one example. The particular condition is quite common, especially in people of European ancestry. A simple blood test is the first step in screening for celiac disease.</p><p>If you have lost more than ten pounds or five percent of your body weight, <b>contact your doctor</b>. If the weight loss is less than this, you might wish to check your weight daily or every other day. If your weight continues to fall over the next few weeks, contact your doctor.</p>
