This is especially true if a person takes water pills (diuretics).</p><p>Weight loss related to water only is not the subject of this guide. Weight loss in this guide refers to a decrease in &quot;dry&quot; weight.</p><p>Most people who lose weight and are concerned about it&#xA0;often have a diminished appetite.</p><p><b>Has your appetite decreased?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/unintentional-weight-loss-4.html">Yes, my appetite has decreased.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/unintentional-weight-loss-3.html">No, my appetite is still good.</a></p>
