<p>You may have&#xA0;Raynaud&apos;s phenomenon. In this condition, blood vessels in the fingers narrow more than normal when exposed to cold. The color changes (typically white, then blue, then red) tend to reverse after a few minutes or with warming.</p><p>This is a very common condition and affects women more than men. In fact, up to ten percent of women report these symptoms. In nine out of ten cases, Raynaud&apos;s is not associated with any other type of disease. In the other one out of ten cases, it may accompany a rheumatic disease such as lupus or scleroderma. These conditions would be rare causes of hand pain as the only symptom.</p><p><b>Contact your physician to see if you have Raynaud&apos;s phenomenon or an associated condition.</b></p><p><b>Would you like to learn more about the most common causes of hand pain?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/hand-pain-18.html">Yes, I&apos;d like to learn more about hand pain.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/hand-pain-19.html">No, I&apos;m all set, ready to quit.</a></p>
