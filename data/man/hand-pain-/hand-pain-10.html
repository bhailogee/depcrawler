This condition, usually due to an injured or compressed disc between the bones of the spine, is called&#xA0;cervical radiculopathy.</p><p>However, your neck pain could be coincidental and have nothing to do with your hand symptoms. <b>Contact your doctor&apos;s office</b>, especially if it persists for more than a few days.</p><p><b>Would you like to learn more about the most common causes of hand pain?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/hand-pain-18.html">Yes, I&apos;d like to learn more about hand pain.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/hand-pain-19.html">No, I&apos;m all set, ready to quit.</a></p>
