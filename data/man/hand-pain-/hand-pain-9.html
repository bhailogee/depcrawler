					<h1>Hand Pain</h1>
<p>Okay.</p><p>Your symptoms suggest the possibility of carpal tunnel syndrome or another nerve problem in the hand. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition and occurs because a major nerve in the wrist (called the median nerve) travels through a narrow area (called the carpal tunnel) where it can be easily compressed. The median nerve provides sensation to the fingers (particularly the thumb, index, middle and half the ring finger) and controls the muscles in the thumb. The usual symptoms are numbness and tingling; weakness and shrinkage (or atrophy) of the large thumb muscle near the wrist may follow.</p><p><b>If your symptoms persist, see your doctor for evaluation that can confirm the diagnosis.</b></p><p><b>Would you like to learn more about the most common causes of hand pain?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/hand-pain-18.html">Yes, I&apos;d like to learn more about hand pain.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/hand-pain-19.html">No, I&apos;m all set, ready to quit.</a></p>
