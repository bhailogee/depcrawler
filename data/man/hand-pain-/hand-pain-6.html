					<h1>Hand Pain</h1>
<p>So, your hand pain did not start after a significant injury, there&apos;s no swelling, redness or stiffness, there&apos;s no bony enlargement of the joints, no numbness, tingling or color changes.</p><p>That&apos;s good! You have no symptoms that suggest a serious cause of hand pain, but you also have none of the more common symptoms that might suggest the cause. The most likely explanation is&#xA0;tendonitis, an inflammation of one or more tendons in the hand which often causes no swelling or redness. Overuse related to repetitive motion is a common cause, but often no cause can be found. Rest is probably the best treatment. And unless you have been instructed to avoid them, try over-the-counter aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen or acetaminophen.</p><p><b>Contact your doctor</b> if your symptoms persist for more than two weeks.</p><p><b>Would you like to learn more about the most common causes of hand pain?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/hand-pain-18.html">Yes, I&apos;d like to learn more about hand pain.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/hand-pain-19.html">No, I&apos;m all set, ready to quit.</a></p>
