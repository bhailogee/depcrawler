Over-the-counter pain medications, topical treatments (such as IcyHot or BenGay), or the application of ice may also provide some relief.</p><p>Here are some other ideas:</p><p>Rest. For example, if playing tennis or jogging preceded your diffuse pain, avoid those activities until the pain has subsided or resolved.</p><p>Stretch often.

If pain persists, use a heating pad on the sore area.</p><p>Consult a physical therapist or other practitioner. For some individuals, a supervised stretching and exercise program, ultrasound treatment, electrical stimulation, or alternative approaches (e.g., massage and chiropractic care) may help.</p><ul><li><p>Use a heating pad on the sore area.
