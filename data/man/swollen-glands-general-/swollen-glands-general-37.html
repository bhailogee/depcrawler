					<h1>Swollen Glands (General)</h1>
<p><b>Contact your doctor.</b> You may have an abscess. An abscess contains pus, which is a combination of bacteria and lymphocytes, the body&apos;s cells that fight infection. The pus needs to be drained for the infection to heal. You can try placing a warm compress on the abscess to try and get it to open by itself. However if it does not open on its own, if you have fevers, or if it is very painful, you should see your doctor to have the abscess drained.</p>
