<p>Mild swelling of both feet and ankles is quite common. Many people notice slight swelling after prolonged standing or sitting in one position, especially on hot days. If you have no other symptoms and the swelling goes down just by raising your legs for a few hours, then the swelling is likely to be more of a nuisance than anything serious.</p><p>Sometimes arthritis will cause swelling in both feet and ankles. Usually the swelling will not travel up the leg. Also with arthritis, there is almost always some pain.</p><p><b>Do you think the swelling might be caused by arthritis?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/leg-swelling-edema-new-onset-6.html">Yes, I think so.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/leg-swelling-edema-new-onset-5.html">Nope, doesn&apos;t sound like me.</a></p>
