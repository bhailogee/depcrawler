					<h1>Dry Skin</h1>
<p>Dry air sucks water out of the skin. Consider using a good moisturizer to keep moisture from leaving your skin. Also consider using a humidifier in your home. During the winter, heated indoor air can be very dry. During the summer, air cooled with an air conditioner can also be very dry.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Another relevant factor is the amount of time your skin is directly exposed to water. Although you might think this is a good thing, it may not be. Hot showers and baths remove oils from the skin that help hold in moisture.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><b>Do you frequently take hot baths or showers?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/dry-skin-13.html">Yes, I often take hot baths or showers.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/dry-skin-12.html">No, only occasionally.</a></p>
