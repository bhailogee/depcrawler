					<h1>Imbalance</h1>
<p>Alright. Your imbalance could be due to an inner ear problem, such as Meniere&apos;s disease or benign positional vertigo. A viral infection or ear injury could also cause your symptoms. These conditions tend to get better over time or after treatment. <b>See your doctor for evaluation and to learn about specific treatments.</b></p><p><b>Did you start taking any medications around the time that your imbalance began?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/imbalance-11.html">Yes, that is true for me.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/imbalance-10.html">Nope, I&apos;m not taking any new medicines.</a></p>
