					<h1>Loss of Control of Urine in Men</h1>
					<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Welcome to this Guide about Loss of Urine Control for men.</p><p>Loss of urine or bladder control (also known as incontinence)&#xA0;is a surprisingly common problem, especially in older men.&#xA0; It&apos;s estimated that 1.5 to five percent of men under age 65 experience problems with urine control.&#xA0; After age 65 this number increases to between 15 and 30 percent, and up to half of people in nursing homes lose control of their bladder for some or all of the time.</p><p>Loss of urine control may develop for a number of reasons.&#xA0; Problems with the bladder and prostate gland are probably the most common, but in many men the cause lies outside of the urinary tract.&#xA0; For example, severe constipation and certain medications can reduce bladder control.&#xA0; In some men, more than one problem is present.</p><p>It&apos;s also important to realize that some causes of incontinence are quite simple, while others are very serious.&#xA0; In the same way, some causes of incontinence may be easy to treat, while others may be long-lasting.</p><p><b>Men who experience new loss of urine control should see their doctor.</b> This guide is intended to provide helpful information while you are awaiting further evaluation, or to add to what you may have already learned after an evaluation by your doctor.&#xA0; Please keep in mind that this information cannot replace a face-to-face evaluation with your own health care provider.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/loss-of-control-of-urine-in-men-2.html">Click here to start.</a></p>
