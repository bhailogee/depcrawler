					<h1>Loss of Control of Urine in Men</h1>
<p><b>Contact your doctor immediately, or go to the nearest emergency facility!</b></p><p>Although it may turn out that there is no serious or dangerous condition to explain your symptoms, loss of bladder control along with weakness, numbness, tingling, difficulty speaking or loss of balance could be a sign of a serious brain or spinal cord problem, such as bleeding, a stroke or a tumor. The same is true if you lose control of both your bladder and bowels, especially if you also experience back pain or weakness in your legs. You should have an urgent medical evaluation.</p><p>You can return to this guide for more information later, once you have been evaluated.</p>
