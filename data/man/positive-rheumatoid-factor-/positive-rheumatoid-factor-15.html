					<h1>Positive Rheumatoid Factor</h1>
<p>It&apos;s possible that you have rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but when symptoms are present for less than six weeks, it is difficult to be sure, even with a positive RF result. That&apos;s because the joint symptoms and positive rheumatoid factor could be due to a virus that the body will fight off in short order--and then, all of your symptoms should go away. It&apos;s also possible you have a condition related to RA, such as lupus or Sjogren&apos;s syndrome.</p><p><b>Would you like more information about the rheumatoid factor and various forms of arthritis?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/positive-rheumatoid-factor-27.html">Yes, I&apos;d like more information.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/positive-rheumatoid-factor-26.html">No, I&apos;m all set, thanks.</a></p>
