<p>Okay. There are a number of possible explanations for your symptoms and a positive RF (see link below for more detailed information on these conditions).</p><p>The positive RF along with the symptoms you mention could be indications of a rheumatologic condition such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or a closely related condition.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><p>dry eyes and/or dry mouth with a positive RF may be evidence of Sjogren&apos;s syndrome (some people with rheumatoid arthritis have similar symptoms, so the distinction may be difficult)</p></li><li><p>joint pain, rashes and/or mouth sores, and almost any of the other symptoms mentioned are typical in people with lupus</p></li><li><p>tight, shiny skin and Raynaud&apos;s may indicate scleroderma.</p></li><li><p>Because you have had rather prolonged joint symptoms along with other problems that could indicate rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or another rheumatic disease, it is important that you <b>contact your doctor</b> for prompt evaluation.
