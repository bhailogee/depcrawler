					<h1>Positive Rheumatoid Factor</h1>
<p>Your symptoms could be due to an infection. Most infections do not go on for six or more weeks, but occasionally it happens.</p><p>Examples include</p><ul><li><p>a bloodstream infection (called subacute bacterial endocarditis)</p></li><li><p>virus infections (such as those in the &quot;mono&quot; family)</p></li><li><p>chronic forms of hepatitis.</p></li></ul><p>On the other hand, some arthritic disease unrelated to infection can cause fever. Lupus is a good example; rheumatoid arthritis is possible whenever the RF is positive and there is arthritis, but fever this high is unusual. Of course, the fever could be unrelated to the joint trouble.&#xA0;&#xA0;People with arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis) can get a fever from a cold or the flu or another infection that is coincidental.</p><p><b>Contact your doctor</b> for evaluation to be sure you do not have an infection causing your joint symptoms and positive RF.</p><p><b>Would you like more information about the rheumatoid factor and various forms of arthritis?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/positive-rheumatoid-factor-27.html">Yes, I&apos;d like more information.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/positive-rheumatoid-factor-26.html">No, I&apos;m all set, thanks.</a></p>
