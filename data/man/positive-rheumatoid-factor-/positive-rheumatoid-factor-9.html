It is a bacterial infection of a heart valve. While fairly rare, it tends to occur in people who have an abnormal heart valve to begin with, especially after having bacteria in the blood (as may occur during visits to the dentist for routine cleaning or other care). It can also occur in people who use intravenous drugs.</p><p>Because endocarditis is a serious infection that requires prompt detection and treatment, it is important that you <b>contact your doctor right away for evaluation.</b></p><p><b>Would you like more information about the rheumatoid factor and various forms of arthritis?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/positive-rheumatoid-factor-27.html">Yes, I&apos;d like more information.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/positive-rheumatoid-factor-26.html">No, I&apos;m all set, thanks.</a></p>
