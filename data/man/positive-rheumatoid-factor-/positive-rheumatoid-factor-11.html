<p>Sorry to hear that. Now, to sort out whether your joint pain has anything to do with the rheumatoid factor:</p><p><b>Do you have four or more joints that are painful?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/positive-rheumatoid-factor-17.html">Yes, I have four or more painful joints.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/positive-rheumatoid-factor-12.html">No, I have three or fewer painful joints.</a></p>
