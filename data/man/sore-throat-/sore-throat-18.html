					<h1>Sore Throat</h1>
<p>Some viruses will cause a more prolonged sore throat along with fever and body aches. Infectious mononucleosis caused by the Epstein-Barr virus can do this.</p><p><b>Contact your doctor.</b></p><p>Infectious mononucleosis is diagnosed by a blood test. If you have infectious mononucleosis, you will likely take a longer time to feel better. It may be several days to a couple weeks before you are ready to go back to school or work.</p><p>If mononucleosis is suspected, your doctor will carefully examine your spleen for signs of enlargement, a potential complication of &quot;mono.&quot; If your spleen is enlarged, you will need to avoid contact sports for a few months to avoid serious injury to your spleen.</p>
