					<h1>Sore Throat</h1>
<p>Normally most of our breathing is through our nose. The nose adds moisture to the air that goes into our lungs. With persistent nasal congestion, you will have more mouth breathing that dries the surfaces of the mouth and throat. This can cause a prolonged sore throat.</p><p>Also post nasal drip from the nose or sinuses can irritate the back of the throat.</p><p>A sore throat caused by nasal congestion or post nasal drip is often worse in the morning when you first wake up. You might also notice a tickle at the back of the throat and coughing.</p><p><b>Do you persistently have two or more of the following symptoms:</b></p><ul><li><p><b>nasal congestion</b></p></li><li><p><b>runny nose</b></p></li><li><p><b>cough</b></p></li><li><p><b>a tickle at the back of the throat?</b></p></li></ul><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/sore-throat-16.html">Yes, these symptoms apply to me.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/sore-throat-13.html">No, I do not have these symptoms.</a></p>
