					<h1>Sore Throat</h1>
<p>Most likely, you have a mild viral infection or allergies. In the next few days, you may develop new symptoms that help make a diagnosis. In that case, you should try going through this tool again from the start. <b>If you do not feel better by the end of two weeks, make an appointment to see your health care provider.</b> While you may just have a viral infection or a mild case of allergies, you want to make sure you don&apos;t miss other more serious causes of a sore throat. Especially, if you are a smoker or have ever been a smoker, you want to make sure you do not have a tumor or throat cancer.</p>
