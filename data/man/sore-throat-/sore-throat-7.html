					<h1>Sore Throat</h1>
<p>You may have an infection or inflammation of your vocal cords known as laryngitis. In most cases, laryngitis is caused by a virus and antibiotics will not speed recovery.</p><p>In some cases, laryngitis is caused by stomach acid leaking back up the esophagus toward the throat (called gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD). Other reasons for laryngitis may be overuse of voice such as prolonged loud talking or shouting, or smoking, especially when combined with drinking alcohol.</p><p><b>See your health care professional</b> if your sore throat and hoarse voice do not go away after a couple of weeks. A hoarse voice that doesn&apos;t go away could be a sign of a tumor. People who smoke or have smoked in the past are at higher risk for a throat tumor.</p>
