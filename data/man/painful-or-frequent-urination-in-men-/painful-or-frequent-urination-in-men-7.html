					<h1>Painful or Frequent Urination in Men</h1>
<p>Frequent urination can be a sign of several different medical conditions. Sometimes the problem is located in the urinary tract -- for example, an enlarged prostate can cause this -- but sometimes a system-wide medical problem, such as diabetes, can produce the same symptoms.</p><p>To sort out the cause of your symptoms, it will be helpful for you to answer some additional questions about symptoms.</p><p>Let&apos;s first find out what your urine looks like, since blood in the urine usually points to a problem in the urinary tract itself. You may notice a pink or red tinge to the urine, or small clots. Blood in the urine can also have a dark color, like cola.</p><p><b>Have you noticed any blood in your urine?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/painful-or-frequent-urination-in-men-20.html">Yes, I&apos;ve noticed blood in my urine.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/painful-or-frequent-urination-in-men-8.html">No, I have not noticed blood in my urine.</a></p>
