					<h1>Painful or Frequent Urination in Men</h1>
<p><b>Contact your doctor.</b> A discharge from the penis that occurs with pain during urination could be due to urethritis. The discharge may be clear, green, yellow or gray, but any discharge should be evaluated by your doctor. Most cases of urethritis are caused by sexually transmitted disease such as gonorrhea or chlamydia. You should have a medical evaluation, and may need antibiotic treatment. It&apos;s important that you <b>avoid sexual contact</b> until you have been evaluated and treated; if you do have a sexually transmitted disease, your sexual partners should be notified, evaluated and treated as well.</p><p>You&apos;ve completed this Decision Guide!</p><p><b>Would you like to learn more about causes of painful or frequent urination?
