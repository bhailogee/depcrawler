					<h1>Shortness of Breath in Adults</h1>
<p>Recent onset shortness of breath with wheezing is probably a condition called reactive airways disease. This means that the bronchial tubes are irritated and in response produce more mucous and get narrow.</p><p>Quite commonly an upper respiratory infection like a chest cold can cause reactive airways. The wheezing, cough and shortness of breath can persist for several weeks to a few months after the cold resolves. New wheezing can also be the start of asthma, perhaps triggered by an allergy to something inside the home or office or outdoor pollen.</p><p>Some people wheeze only during exercise, called exercise-induced asthma.</p><p><b>Contact your doctor.</b> Your doctor may prescribe an inhaler to open the bronchial tubes, possibly with a second inhaler to decrease the inflammation inside the airways.</p>
