					<h1>Blood in the Urine in Men</h1>
<p>Good.</p><p>You may be able to manage your symptoms at home for now. Unless you&apos;ve been told to avoid non-prescription pain relievers, you can try acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve) for your pain. You should force fluids to try to flush out the stone -- this really works.</p><p>You should contact your doctor if</p><ul><li><p>You need a stronger pain reliever.</p></li><li><p>You are experiencing nausea that makes it hard to keep down fluids.</p></li><li><p>You develop a temperature over 100.5 degrees F.</p></li><li><p>Your pain continues for more than 48 to 72 hours.</p></li></ul><p>If your symptoms improve, you may not need immediate evaluation by your doctor. You may see a tiny dark stone as it passes out of your body into the toilet. (If so, fish it out -- your doctor may want to send it to the laboratory for analysis). However, keep in mind that you <b>will</b> eventually need to see your doctor to make sure that no microscopic traces of blood remain in the urine, and that no other stones can be found in the kidneys.</p><p>Check out this link to read more about kidney stones.</p><p>.</p><p><b>You&apos;ve completed this Decision Guide - we hope it was helpful!
