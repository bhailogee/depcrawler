					<h1>Blood in the Urine in Men</h1>
<p>Blood in the urine can be quite alarming, but keep in mind that it&apos;s unusual for men to bleed large amounts through the urine. Even a small drop of blood can turn an entire toilet bowl of water bright red.</p><p>However, large blood clots can be dangerous because they can block the flow of urine. They can also cause a fair amount of discomfort as they pass out of the bladder. In general, any blood clot that&apos;s bigger than the tip of your little finger would be considered to be large.</p><p><b>Have you passed one or more large clots in the urine?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/blood-in-the-urine-in-men-28.html">Yes, I&apos;ve passed one or more large clots.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/blood-in-the-urine-in-men-3.html">No, I&apos;m passing only small clots or my urine is just red.</a></p>
