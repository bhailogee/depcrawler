<p>Based on your answers, it&apos;s difficult to identify a single likely cause of the blood in your urine. In many people, small amounts of blood are harmless, and no specific cause may be found even after an extensive evaluation.</p><p>Still, it&apos;s important that you <b>contact your doctor</b>; until you have an evaluation it&apos;s impossible to know whether the blood in your urine might signal an important medical condition.</p><p>Your doctor will usually start by performing a physical examination and analyzing a urine specimen. If no cause for the bleeding is apparent, your doctor may refer you to a specialist (such as a urologist or nephrologist), or order additional tests such as</p><ul><li><p>a&#xA0;computed tomography &#xA0;(CT) scan of the abdomen</p></li><li><p>an&#xA0;ultrasound &#xA0;of the kidneys</p></li><li><p>an older type of x-ray known as an intravenous pyelogram (IVP)</p></li><li><p>a&#xA0;cystoscopy, which uses a thin flexible telescope to look at the lining of the bladder.</p></li></ul><p><b>You&apos;ve completed this Decision Guide -- we hope it was helpful!
