					<h1>Insomnia</h1>
<p>You have not identified any significant problems with your sleep habits or your sleep environs that provide an obvious explanation for your insomnia. You may find it helpful to speak to your doctor about your insomnia symptoms, so that your doctor can consider testing your thyroid and blood chemistry if your medical history suggests a specific medical problem that could be the cause.</p><p>Many people with insomnia find it very helpful to obtain training in relaxation or &quot;biofeedback&quot; techniques, such as tightening and relaxing each of your muscles in a planned order. Relaxation exercises before bed can greatly enhance your ability to get a full night&apos;s sleep.</p><p>Most people do not require medications to assist with sleep. If your sleep problems do not respond quickly to simple strategies to improve your sleep, you may obtain relief from a doctor&apos;s prescription for a sleep aid to use for a short term (typically less than two weeks). Over-the-counter sleep treatments can cause symptoms that persist into daytime hours and are not recommended.</p><p>Click&#xA0;here&#xA0;for more information on insomnia.</p>
