					<h1>Insomnia</h1>
<p><b>Chest pain is always concerning until it is explained, because it may result from coronary artery disease. You should discuss your symptoms with your doctor if you are over fifty or have other risk factors for heart disease, such as smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, or a family history.</b></p><p>Some people have an increase in blood pressure during the night due to nocturnal shifts in hormones, and this can provoke angina. Angina is the symptom of pain from inadequate oxygen delivery to a part of the heart.</p><p>Less concerning causes of chest pain are also possible. A very common example is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD, acid reflux), which can be provoked by lying flat.</p>
