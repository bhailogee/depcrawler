					<h1>Insomnia</h1>
<p>There are several ways that your breathing can be interrupted during the night. If your breathing has been interrupted because of an upper airway blockage, then you typically can recover your breath immediately upon awakening. Respiratory discomfort that is caused by another problem may take slightly longer to resolve.</p><p><b>Please pick the statement that most closely describes your symptoms upon awakening:</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/insomnia-37.html">I must sit upright to breathe and recovery may take minutes.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/insomnia-36.html">I snore or choke on awakening but catch my breath right away.</a></p>
