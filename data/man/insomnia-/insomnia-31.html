					<h1>Insomnia</h1>
<p><b>Because your sleep problem is jeopardizing your safety, you need to have a full evaluation by your doctor or a specialist.</b></p><p>Unless you are able to easily identify a problem that explains your sleeping problems, it would be reasonable for your doctor to consider having your sleep formally observed by a specialized technician. Many medical centers have laboratories that are designed to monitor people with insomnia during their sleep. These &quot;sleep labs&quot; can identify changes in your breathing, heart rate, and brainwave pattern during sleep and can help to identify a specific cause of sleep interruptions.</p><p>Examples of serious sleep disorders include sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and parasomnia (sleep with sleepwalking).</p>
