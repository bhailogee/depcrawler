<p><b>Since you are a man, appendicitis is the most likely cause of pain in the right lower abdomen along with fever. Seek an urgent evaluation by your doctor.</b></p><p>Appendicitis is the most dangerous cause of a fever and right-sided lower abdominal pain, but other causes may be considered.</p><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (such as &quot;Crohn&apos;s disease&quot;) can cause inflammation in an area of bowel that is close to the appendix, and it can also result in a fever.</p><p>An abscess can occur anywhere in the abdomen. An abscess could also explain your symptoms.</p><p>Your symptoms could also come from &quot;colitis,&quot; an infection or inflammation of the colon.</p><p>One common cause of colitis is an infection that can develop following antibiotic treatment. Infections from contaminated food, such as salmonella, shigella, or campylobacter can cause similar symptoms.</p><p><a href="/enc/pseudomembranous-colitis.html">Click here for more information on antibiotic-associated diarrhea.</a></p>
