					<h1>Understanding New and Severe Abdominal Pain</h1>
<p>The vast majority of problems that result in periumbilical pain are associated with the digestive tract. One important condition is not, and that is an expansion (aneurysm) of the large artery in the abdomen, your aorta. This artery can become deformed and can cause symptoms if it is affected by atherosclerosis (artery disease). Disease of the aorta should be considered if you are high risk for atherosclerosis:</p><p><b>Do you have a history of heart disease, stroke, aortic aneurysm, or other artery disease</b></p><p><b><i>or</i></b></p><p><b>Are you over 50 years old</b></p><p><b><i>or</i></b></p><p><b>Do you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or a smoking history?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/understanding-new-and-severe-abdominal-pain-110.html">Yes, I have one of these risks.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/understanding-new-and-severe-abdominal-pain-109.html">No, I am at low risk for artery disease.</a></p>
