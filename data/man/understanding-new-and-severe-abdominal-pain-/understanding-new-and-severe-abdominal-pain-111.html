<p>Fortunately, you do not report some of the symptoms that are most worrisome when they occur with periumbilical abdominal pain. It is very likely that your symptoms are arising from irritation of your small bowel. Many problems that can result in your symptom are non-threatening and self-limited. However, it is possible that you are having the first symptoms of a more serious illness. Please watch your symptoms closely and consult your doctor right away if you develop a fever, pain in the right side of your abdomen, or vomiting.</p><p>Some of the more common diagnoses that can explain your symptoms follow.</p><p><a href="/enc/gastroesophageal-reflux-disease.html">Click here for information on gastroesophageal reflux.</a></p><p><a href="/enc/constipation.html">Click here for information on constipation.</a></p><p><a href="/enc/gas-flatulence.html">Click here for information on gas.</a></p>
