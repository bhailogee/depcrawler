					<h1>Understanding New and Severe Abdominal Pain</h1>
<p><b>When diarrhea is not a prominent symptom, fever and pain in the lower abdomen can be signs of a serious infection. You should have your symptoms evaluated by a doctor right away.</b></p><p>Although you do not have specific symptoms that link your fever and pain to your uterus, tubes, or ovaries, a pelvic infection must be considered. An abscess near to the colon could also explain your symptoms.</p><p>You are younger than 50, but if you are approaching this age (particularly if you have a history of constipation) you may have the infection, &quot;diverticulitis.&quot; Many adults form &quot;diverticuli&quot; as they age, which are hollow tubular bulges that branch from the colon lining like small pockets. These pockets can accumulate bacteria and can cause symptoms much like appendicitis, but on the left side. Between episodes of infection, diverticuli can be asymptomatic, or they may cause pain or brisk bleeding.</p>
