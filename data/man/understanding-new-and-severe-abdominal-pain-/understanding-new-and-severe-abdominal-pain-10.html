					<h1>Understanding New and Severe Abdominal Pain</h1>
<p><b>Due to your age, you are at risk for several serious medical problems that could explain widespread abdominal pain. You urgently need to discuss your symptoms with your doctor.</b></p><p>The arteries that feed your bowel are susceptible to narrowing in any person who has atherosclerosis (cholesterol-associated artery damage). Sometimes, a blockage in an artery to the bowel will create diffuse abdominal pain. Impaired circulation to your intestine is called &quot;intestinal angina&quot; or &quot;ischemic intestine.&quot;</p><p>Many adults form &quot;diverticuli&quot; as they age, which are hollow tubular bulges that branch from the colon lining like small pockets. These pockets can accumulate bacteria and can cause pain or brisk bleeding.</p><p>Your pain could also be explained by a more mundane medical problem. Common causes of diffuse abdominal pain that might explain your symptoms include a viral infection (gastroenteritis), gas, constipation, an irritable colon, or a metabolic abnormality such as high calcium.</p><p><a href="/enc/diverticulitis.html">Click here for more information on diverticulosis.</a></p><p><a href="/enc/irritable-bowel-syndrome.html">Click here for more information on irritable bowel syndrome.</a></p>
