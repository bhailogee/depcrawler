<p>This area of the abdomen is called the &quot;epigastric&quot; area because it is where your stomach is located. In this area, you can feel pain that arises from one of the following organs:</p><ul><li><p>heart</p></li><li><p>esophagus</p></li><li><p>stomach</p></li><li><p>duodenum (part of your small intestine)</p></li><li><p>pancreas</p></li><li><p>aorta.</p></li></ul><p>In order to narrow down our list, it will be helpful to know the character of your pain. If your pain feels like a burn or feels like it is gnawing, then it is probably from one of the organs on this list that is exposed to digestive acid.</p><p><b>What does your pain feel like?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/understanding-new-and-severe-abdominal-pain-125.html">My pain is burning or gnawing.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/understanding-new-and-severe-abdominal-pain-116.html">My pain is aching, sharp, crampy, heavy, squeezing, or dull.</a></p>
