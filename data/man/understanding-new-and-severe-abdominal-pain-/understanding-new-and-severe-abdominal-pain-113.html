					<h1>Understanding New and Severe Abdominal Pain</h1>
<p><b>Nausea or vomiting and pain in the periumbilical area are both symptoms that commonly occur during the early stages of appendicitis or during a bowel obstruction. You should have your symptoms evaluated by a doctor today.</b></p><p>If you have an infected appendix, you are likely to first feel pain symptoms near to your navel. Later on, it is typical for the pain to relocate to the right lower abdomen. Fever is common but may not occur in the early stages of the infection.</p><p>If you also have a feeling of bloating or fullness, it is possible that your symptoms are the result of a bowel obstruction. This is particularly likely if you have ever had abdominal surgery in your past, since scarring that is left after surgery can predispose you to developing a blocked intestine.</p><p>A very common illness that can result in your symptoms of periumbilical pain and vomiting or nausea is the viral infection, gastroenteritis. Diarrhea or a recent exposure to someone else with the illness would suggest this diagnosis.</p><p>Finally, pancreatitis or hernias can cause you to experience the pain in this area. Nausea or vomiting can accompany these illnesses.</p>
