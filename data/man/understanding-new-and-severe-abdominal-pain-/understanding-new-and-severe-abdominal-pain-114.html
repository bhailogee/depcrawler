					<h1>Understanding New and Severe Abdominal Pain</h1>
<p><b>Fever and pain in the periumbilical area are both symptoms that occur during the early stages of appendicitis. You should have your symptoms evaluated by a doctor right away.</b></p><p>If you have an infected appendix, you are likely to first feel pain symptoms near your navel. Later on, it is typical for the pain to relocate to the right lower abdomen. Fever is common but may not occur in the early stages of the infection.</p><p>A more common and less serious infection that can cause pain in the periumbilical area is the viral infection, &quot;gastroenteritis.&quot; Diarrhea or a recent exposure to someone else with the illness would suggest this diagnosis.</p><p>Pancreatitis usually causes pain higher than the navel, but it is possible to experience the pain in the navel area in some cases. Fever can accompany this illness.</p>
