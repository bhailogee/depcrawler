					<h1>Understanding New and Severe Abdominal Pain</h1>
<p><b>Your pain and expanding waistline could be a sign of a serious medical illness, particularly if you have nausea or vomiting along with your other symptoms! Seek a medical evaluation immediately!</b></p><p>Increasing abdominal girth (belt size) can result from fat, from an enlarged liver or spleen, from gas in the intestines, from distended intestines (due to a bowel obstruction) or from pregnancy. Less commonly, the abdomen can expand due to a tumor, or due to fluid accumulation around your abdominal organs and beneath the peritoneum (abdominal wall lining). Fluid that accumulates in this area is called &quot;ascites,&quot; and it can be a complication of cirrhosis of the liver or certain other illnesses.</p><p>Because your pain is accompanied by expansion of your abdomen, the most likely explanations for your pain would be gas, bowel obstruction, constipation with or without a total blockage from stool (fecal impaction), or (if you have cirrhosis of the liver) ascites or infected ascites.</p>
