					<h1>Understanding New and Severe Abdominal Pain</h1>
<p>Because you have chest pain with it, it is most likely that your abdominal pain is coming from your heart or your esophagus.</p><p><b>Your pain may be a symptom of a heart attack! If you think you could be having a heart attack, you should chew an aspirin tablet if one is available and seek emergency care immediately!</b></p><p>Common symptoms that accompany the pain of a heart attack include nausea, shortness of breath, sweating, and arm or neck symptoms.</p><p>If you are not having symptoms from heart disease, it is likely you are experiencing heartburn from gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD.</p>
