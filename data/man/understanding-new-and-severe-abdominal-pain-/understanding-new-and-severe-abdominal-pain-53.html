					<h1>Understanding New and Severe Abdominal Pain</h1>
<p>One dangerous diagnosis that must be considered when you have pain in the right lower abdomen is appendicitis.</p><p>We would like you to consider a special pattern of pain that appendicitis can cause. If you have an infected appendix, you are likely to <i>first</i> feel pain symptoms near your navel. Later on, it is typical for the pain to relocate to the right lower abdomen. Fever is common but may not occur in the early stages of the infection.</p><p><b>Did your pain begin in the center of your abdomen, moving to your right lower abdomen sometime later?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/understanding-new-and-severe-abdominal-pain-73.html">Yes, this describes my pain.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/understanding-new-and-severe-abdominal-pain-54.html">No, this does not describe my pain.</a></p>
