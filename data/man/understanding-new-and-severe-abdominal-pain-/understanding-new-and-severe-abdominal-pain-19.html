					<h1>Understanding New and Severe Abdominal Pain</h1>
<p><b>You have reported that you have pain with even minimal motion of the abdomen. This is concerning because it suggests you may have an inflamed abdominal lining, a condition known as &quot;peritonitis.&quot;</b></p><p><b><i>Seek emergency care immediately!</i></b></p><p>Peritonitis can be the result of a severe abdominal infection such as appendicitis or diverticulitis. It may also be a sign of life-threatening abdominal contamination due to a hole (perforation) in the stomach or intestines. Usually, a perforation is a complication of a peptic ulcer (a sore in the wall of the stomach or duodenum).</p><p>If you have cirrhosis of the liver, you may accumulate fluid called &quot;ascites&quot; beneath the peritoneum. Ascites can result in severe abdominal pain if it becomes infected.</p>
