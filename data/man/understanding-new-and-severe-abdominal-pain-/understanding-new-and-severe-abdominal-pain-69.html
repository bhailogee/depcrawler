					<h1>Understanding New and Severe Abdominal Pain</h1>
<p>It is very likely that your pain is caused by normal menstruation. The symptom of pain with menstruation is named &quot;dysmenorrhea.&quot; Usually, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory pain medicines such as ibuprofen are very helpful.</p><p>Another problem that can cause pain before or during menses is &quot;endometriosis.&quot; Endometriosis occurs when endometrial tissue (tissue that is normally found lining the inside of the uterus) is present in the pelvis or abdomen <i>outside</i> of the uterus. Endometrial tissue can ooze blood at the time of your menses, wherever this tissue is located.</p><p>It is also possible that your pain is coming from an ovarian cyst. Cysts can cause pain if they swell, if they rupture, or if they become infected.</p><p>If your pain is severe, if it persists for longer than a day, or if you develop fever or nausea along with your pain, then you should be evaluated by a doctor to make sure it is not from a more serious problem, such as appendicitis.</p>
