					<h1>Understanding New and Severe Abdominal Pain</h1>
<p>Your vomiting and abdominal pain may be caused by a viral infection (gastroenteritis), but they could be a sign of something more serious. A common, dangerous condition that can cause these symptoms is bowel obstruction. Bowel obstruction should be strongly considered during your doctor&apos;s evaluation if you have not had a recent bowel movement or if you have a history of abdominal or pelvic surgery. Surgery can be result in thread-like or band-like scars in the abdomen that can ensnare a loop of bowel and block the passage of bowel contents.</p><p>Symptoms from food poisoning or viral gastroenteritis should improve after the first day. If your symptoms are severe or if they do not quickly improve, see your doctor for an urgent evaluation.</p>
