					<h1>Understanding New and Severe Abdominal Pain</h1>
<p>Fortunately most of the infections that result in diffuse abdominal pain, fever, and diarrhea are viral infections that cause symptoms only for several days. However, some infections that cause diarrhea require antibiotics to clear and could worsen without treatment.</p><p><b>You should be evaluated by a doctor immediately if your symptoms are severe</b>, if you feel dizzy upon standing due to your loss of fluid from your diarrhea, or if you see blood in your diarrhea. You should also seek immediate medical care if you were treated with antibiotics within the past several months, since the bacteria <i>clostridium difficile</i> can proliferate in the intestine following antibiotic treatment and can cause a severe infection.</p><p>Please consider visiting our Diarrhea Health Decision Guide if your diarrhea symptom is prominent.</p><p><a href="/enc/pseudomembranous-colitis.html">Click here for more information on antibiotic-associated diarrhea.</a></p>
