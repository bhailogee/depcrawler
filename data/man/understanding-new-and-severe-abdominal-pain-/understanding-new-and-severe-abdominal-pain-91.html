					<h1>Understanding New and Severe Abdominal Pain</h1>
<p>The nerves that detect pain within your entire intestine (stomach, small and large intestine, and rectum) were originally &quot;wired&quot; to the midline of your abdomen. As your intestines lengthened and twisted, they spread out across a much larger area. Nonetheless, all areas of your intestine retain nerve connections to your midline, and pain from every area of your intestine can be felt in your midline. You may also feel pain in your midline from a solid organ that is centrally located.
