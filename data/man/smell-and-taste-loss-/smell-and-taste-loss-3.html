But, they may occur separately, so we&apos;ll address one at a time.</p><p><b>Which of the following applies to you?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/smell-and-taste-loss-7.html">The main problem is impaired sense of smell.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/smell-and-taste-loss-6.html">My problem is only loss of taste.</a></p>
