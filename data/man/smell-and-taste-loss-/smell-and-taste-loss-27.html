Or, did you have exposure to toxic fumes (such as paint solvent or formaldehyde)?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/smell-and-taste-loss-29.html">Yes, I did start a new medication or have a toxin exposure.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/smell-and-taste-loss-28.html">No, I did not start a new medication or have toxin exposure.</a></p>
