					<h1>Smell and Taste Loss</h1>
<p>Okay, that&apos;s helpful information because those symptoms may help explain why you have trouble with taste.</p><p>For example:</p><p>- Redness or a sore feeling in the mouth could be due to infection or inflammation, which can impair the sense of taste; potential causes include herpes and Coxsackie virus infections and vitamin B12 deficiency</p><p>- A white coating on the tongue and lining of the mouth may be due to thrush (a yeast infection in the mouth)</p><p>- Dental procedures or implants can impair the sensation of taste, although usually only temporarily</p><p>- Dryness of the mouth (a condition called SICCA) can be due to age, Sjogren&apos;s syndrome (an autoimmune condition), medications, dehydration, and other reasons</p><p>Just a few more questions:</p><p><b>Do you smoke? Are you over the age of 65?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/smell-and-taste-loss-27.html">Yes, I smoke and/or am over age 65.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/smell-and-taste-loss-26.html">Nope, I don&apos;t smoke and I&apos;m 65 or younger.</a></p>
