					<h1>Recurring Abdominal Pain</h1>
<p>You need to be evaluated for bleeding, infection or cancer within your upper digestive tract. <b>Contact your doctor for an urgent evaluation.</b></p><p>Pain with blood in the vomit or blackened stools could represent an ulcer in your stomach or small intestine, irritation in the stomach lining (&quot;gastritis&quot;), or cancer. Fever could arise from an abdominal infection such as an abscess, a cancer, or a break (perforation) in the stomach lining at the site of an ulcer.</p><p>Based on your symptoms, your doctor is likely to recommend evaluation with either an endoscopy test (esophagogastroduodenoscopy, or &quot;EGD&quot;) or a computed tomography scan (CT scan).</p><p>With an EGD, a doctor can view the inside of your esophagus, stomach, and the first segment of your small intestine by way of a flexible tube and camera. This is a particularly helpful test if you have evidence of bleeding from the upper digestive tract.</p><p>Your doctor might choose a computed tomography scan if your symptoms involve fever or weight loss. Certain cancers or infections are visible on a CT scan.</p><p>Some specific diagnoses that your doctor may consider include</p><ul><li><p>stomach cancer</p></li><li><p>gastritis</p></li><li><p>peptic ulcer disease.</p></li></ul>
