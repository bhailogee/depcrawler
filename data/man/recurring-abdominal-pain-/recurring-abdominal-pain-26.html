<p>You seem to be sensitive to milk products, and abdominal cramps may be a consequence of the milk in your diet.</p><p>It is common for people to lose their ability to digest the milk sugar lactose during adulthood. &quot;lactose intolerance&quot; could be a cause of your abdominal pain even if milk digestion used to be normal for you.</p><p><b>About Lactose Intolerance</b></p><p>Undigested lactose passes into your colon where it can nourish bacteria and ferment into gas. Undigested milk products can also cause diarrhea and abdominal cramps.</p><p>Lactose intolerance can be managed with total or near-total avoidance of milk and dairy products. Some people improve symptoms by swallowing a milk digestion aid with meals called lactase (Lactaid).</p><p>One of the most practical steps in your abdominal pain evaluation might be to try a careful elimination diet that excludes milk and milk products. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, additional evaluation might or might not be postponed until your response to diet changes can be judged.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/recurring-abdominal-pain-27.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
