					<h1>Recurring Abdominal Pain</h1>
<p>Because of your risk for heart disease, you must consider the small chance that your abdominal pain could be a cardiac symptom.</p><p>Your pain may be angina, a symptom that is caused when your heart is not getting adequate blood flow.</p><p><b>You urgently need to discuss your symptoms with your doctor.</b></p><p>In your case, the fact that you have pain provoked by exercise makes a cardiac evaluation a high priority. Angina is sometimes felt in the abdomen.</p><p>If you have sweating or shortness of breath accompanying your pain, this too could suggest that you are experiencing angina.</p><p>Your doctor may wish to begin your evaluation with a &quot;stress test&quot; for coronary artery disease. Several different stress tests are available.</p><p><a href="/enc/coronary-heart-disease.html">Click here for more information about coronary artery disease.</a></p><p>Less dangerous causes of your symptoms are, of course, possible. After your doctor considers heart disease as a possible source of your pain, diagnoses that fit well with your symptoms include</p><ul><li><p>gallstones</p></li><li><p>gastritis</p></li><li><p>gastroesophageal reflux disease</p></li><li><p>indigestion (dyspepsia)</p></li><li><p>peptic ulcer disease.</p></li></ul><p>To examine for these conditions, tests that might be considered early in your evaluation include a treatment trial with antiacid medicines, endoscopy (a video evaluation of the esophagus and stomach), a barium swallow x-ray test, or an ultrasound of the abdomen.</p>
