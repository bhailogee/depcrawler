					<h1>Recurring Abdominal Pain</h1>
<p>If your pain is provoked by abrupt pressure in your abdominal cavity (as is caused by a cough or sneeze), it is possible that you have a hernia. A hernia is an area of bowel that can become pinched as it pushes through an accidental opening in the abdomen, such as a tear in your muscular abdominal wall.</p><p>Some hernias create a bulge in the naval area, the middle of the abdomen, or on one side of the groin, but hernias can also occur without a visible bulge.</p><p>Hernias can be difficult to diagnose, since the bowel usually appears normal on tests that are done between attacks. If a hernia is considered likely, your doctor might choose to begin your evaluation with a series of x-rays taken after you swallow a liquid named barium (&quot;upper GI series&quot;) or with a computed tomography scan (CT scan).</p><p>Some problems in the back can cause pain in the abdomen. If you have back pain with your abdominal pain, a back problem should be considered.</p><p>Common problems that can be sensitive to cough, sneezing or straining in the abdomen and can result in abdominal pain include</p><ul><li><p>abdominal (ventral) hernia or umbilical hernia (including abdominal hernia, umbilical hernia, or inguinal (groin) hernia)</p></li><li><p>inguinal hernia (hernia in the groin)</p></li><li><p>muscle strain</p></li><li><p>vertebral disk disease (bulging or ruptured disk)</p></li><li><p>vertebral fracture.</p></li></ul>
