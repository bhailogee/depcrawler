					<h1>Recurring Abdominal Pain</h1>
<p>Lower abdominal pain with bleeding into the stools can be caused by intense inflammation in the bowel. Pain and bleeding can also be caused by a cancer in the intestinal tract. Because you are young, you are more likely to have inflammation than cancer.</p><p><b>Because&#xA0; you have a &quot;red flag&quot; symptom along with your abdominal pain, it is imperative that you have a medical evaluation without delay. Please call your doctor today to arrange an urgent evaluation.</b></p><p>In addition to blood tests, your evaluation might begin with a test that can view the inside of your colon or small intestine. Examples are a colonoscopy or an x-ray series with a swallowed liquid that can be seen on x-ray (&quot;upper GI series&quot;).</p><p>The most common causes of inflammation in the bowel that cause recurrent symptoms are &quot;inflammatory bowel&quot; diseases, including</p><ul><li><p>Crohn&apos;s disease</p></li><li><p>ulcerative colitis.</p></li></ul><p>Other conditions that are less likely to be the cause of your symptoms include</p><ul><li><p>celiac disease (celiac sprue)</p></li><li><p>colon cancer</p></li><li><p>lymphoma.</p></li></ul>
