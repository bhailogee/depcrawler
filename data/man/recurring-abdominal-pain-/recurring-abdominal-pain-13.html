					<h1>Recurring Abdominal Pain</h1>
<p>Your menstrual cycle can cause pain at times separate from your menses. If you notice that your pain recurs monthly, even if it is not present while you are bleeding, your pain may be related to your cycle.</p><p><b>Consider your last several episodes of lower abdominal pain as examples. Did each of your pain episodes occur two weeks prior to the start of a menstrual period?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/recurring-abdominal-pain-20.html">Yes, two weeks prior to my menses sounds about right.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/recurring-abdominal-pain-14.html">No, my symptoms do not cycle on a monthly schedule.</a></p>
