					<h1>Recurring Abdominal Pain</h1>
<p><b>Fever and abdominal pain are a serious medical concern when they occur together, because they can be caused by an infection. Contact your doctor right away to arrange an urgent visit so you can have an examination!</b></p><p>Changes in the colon that occur with age can predispose you to infection. Many adults form &quot;diverticuli,&quot; which are hollow tubular bulges that branch from the colon lining and &quot;dead-end.&quot; These pockets can accumulate bacteria and can cause symptoms much like appendicitis. Between episodes of infection, diverticuli can be asymptomatic, or they may cause pain or brisk bleeding.</p><p>Your doctor is likely to diagnose an infection in your bowel. A computed tomography scan (CT scan) may be helpful in your evaluation.</p><p>Diagnoses that may be considered in your evaluation include</p><ul><li><p>appendicitis</p></li><li><p>diverticulitis.</p></li></ul>
