					<h1>Wheezing in Adults</h1>
<p>Wheezing without shortness of breath could still be asthma. Asthma is more likely to be the cause if you have experienced episodes of wheezing in the past.</p><p>Sometimes people develop wheezing for the first time following an upper respiratory infection such as bronchitis or a cold. The air tubes to&#xA0;the lungs temporarily become &quot;reactive,&quot; meaning that the airways act as though they have temporary asthma. The bronchi get inflamed, produce more mucous, and become more sensitive to cold air, smoke, and other environmental changes.</p><p><b>Did you have a chest cold or upper respiratory infection prior to the onset of wheezing?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/wheezing-in-adults-11.html">Yes, I had a cold before the symptoms started.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/wheezing-in-adults-6.html">No, I have not had a recent chest cold.</a></p>
