					<h1>Wheezing in Adults</h1>
<p>Your symptoms could mean that you have developed asthma or this is just a temporary response to a &quot;trigger.&quot; Some common triggers that cause wheezing are cigarette smoke, indoor allergies such as dust mites, outdoor allergies such as grass and ragweed pollen, pet allergies and air pollution.</p><p>If you identify your trigger, try to avoid it. <b>Call your doctor</b> if your symptoms of wheezing and shortness of breath do not get completely better over the next few days. <b>Call immediately if the symptoms get worse.</b></p>
