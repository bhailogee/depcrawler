<p>Okay.</p><p>Unless there is a reason to avoid these medicines (such as a current or previous stomach ulcer or significant chronic renal failure), the first choice for treating a sudden attack of gout is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).</p><p>There are more than 25 approved NSAIDs and each would probably work for gout; the most commonly used for this condition, however, are ibuprofen, naproxen and indomethacin. They tend to work very well if started at the first hint of an attack. However, some people should not take these medicines and, there are important side effects to consider. The most important ones are</p><ul><li><p>stomach ulcers</p></li><li><p>kidney disease</p></li><li><p>thinning the blood</p></li><li><p>allergies.</p></li></ul><p>A number of less common reactions are also possible.</p><p>Although &quot;as needed&quot; NSAIDs are usually the first choice for gout treatment, there are other options when NSAIDs cannot be taken or when they do not work.</p><p><b>Click below to learn more about these other treatments.
