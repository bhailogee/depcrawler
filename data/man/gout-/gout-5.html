<p>The major options for sudden attacks of gout include</p><ul><li><p>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen or indomethacin</p></li><li><p>corticosteroids such as prednisone pills or by injection</p></li><li><p>colchicine--often high doses are required, whether in pill form or intravenously; diarrhea is common with this approach and persons with kidney and/or liver disease should not take high dose colchicine</p></li><li><p>pain medications.</p></li></ul><p>These treatments are usually necessary only &quot;as needed,&quot; for a few days or a week, until the attack subsides. In fact, even without any treatment, most attacks of gout will subside in a short amount of time.</p><p>For more severe or chronic forms of gout, medicines to reduce the blood urate level, including allopurinol, probenecid or sulfinpyrazone may be prescribed. These medications are typically taken long-term, but can prevent future attacks and reduce the chances of complications, such as joint damage.</p><p><b>Click on the appropriate link below to learn more about the course of gout over time, to learn more about how your particular symptoms might be treated, or to quit.</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/gout-6.html">Course over time</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/gout-7.html">I&apos;d like to learn more about my own specific situation.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/gout-19.html">I&apos;m ready to quit.</a></p>
