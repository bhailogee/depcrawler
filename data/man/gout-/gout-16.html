					<h1>Gout</h1>
<p>Okay, sorry to hear that.</p><p>The reason for all the kidney questions is that people with kidney problems are unlikely to get much benefit (and may be at increased health risks) from medicines that increase urate removal by the kidney.</p><p>Because you&apos;ve had a kidney stone or have chronic kidney disease, allopurinol is probably the best choice to lower your blood urate level. Once it is low enough, attacks of gout should stop and the complications of gout (such as another kidney stone or joint damage) should be markedly reduced or even eliminated. When allopurinol is first started, it is usually accompanied by low dose colchicine or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) -- be sure to talk to your doctor about the specifics if and when you begin taking allopurinol.</p><p><b>Would you like to learn now about treating sudden attacks?
