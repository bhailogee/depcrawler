					<h1>Gout</h1>
<p>Gout can range from mild or severe, episodic or chronic. Persons with gout usually start out with occasional episodes of attacks that get better over a few days (with or without treatment). Over time, however, they may become more severe: more than one joint may be inflamed at the same time, attacks may last longer and respond less well to treatment, and lumps of gout (called tophi, or if there is only one lump, a tophus) may form under the skin or in joints (detectable by x-rays). When tophi are present or when joints are inflamed for weeks at a time, gout is considered &quot;chronic.&quot;</p><p><b>Click on the appropriate link below to learn more about the general treatment options for gout, to learn more about how your particular symptoms might be treated, or to quit.</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/gout-5.html">General treatment guidelines</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/gout-7.html">I&apos;d like to learn more about my own specific situation.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/gout-19.html">I&apos;m ready to quit.</a></p>
