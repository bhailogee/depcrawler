					<h1>Gout</h1>
<p>Excellent! So, just to review: your gout responds well to treatment, is not frequent, has affected only one joint at a time and has not required steroid pills. You have no lumps under the skin, have not been told you have tophi (or, if only one, a tophus), and have not had x-rays showing gout-related damage. And, you&apos;ve never had a kidney stone.</p><p>In this situation, it is reasonable to take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed (unless you are allergic to them or your doctor has instructed you to avoid such medicines). When started at the first hint of an attack, these medicines usually work very well. And you may not ever need any other treatment for your gout.</p><p><b>Would you like to learn more about how attacks of gout may be treated?
