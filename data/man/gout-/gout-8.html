<p>Okay. This raises the possibility that your joint pain is due to something other than gout. It&apos;s worth considering other possibilities (to be considered below). Certain facts make gout more or less likely. For example, gout is&#xA0;<b>unlikely</b> if you are a premenopausal woman. Gout tends to occur in women only when they are at least seven to&#xA0;ten years post-menopausal. It can occur in men of any age, though it is unusual in teenagers and is more common in older men or in people with a family history of gout.</p><p>Gout is&#xA0;<b>likely</b> if you have had repeated episodes of sudden first (big) toe pain and swelling that gets better without antibiotics over a few days, even if joint fluid has never been removed or examined.</p><p>Most experts agree that it is not always necessary to prove the diagnosis of gout by removing joint fluid; symptoms and examination alone may be so compelling that proof is unnecessary. On the other hand, you cannot diagnose gout from a blood test and often it is very helpful to prove the diagnosis by removing a bit of fluid.</p><p>Talk with your doctor about how certain the diagnosis of gout is.</p><p>Mimics of gout include certain infections and other types of arthritis including pseudogout, psoriatic arthritis, arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease, Reiter&apos;s syndrome and ankylosing spondylitis.</p><p>The next questions deal with the severity of your gout or problems that might be related to gout.</p><p><b>Is&#xA0;one or more of the following statements true for you?</b></p><ul><li><p><b>I&apos;ve had gout in more than one joint at the same time.</b></p></li><li><p><b>I have frequent attacks (4 or more times in a year).</b></p></li><li><p><b>I have lumps under the skin (or have been told I have tophi).</b></p></li><li><p><b>I have had one or more kidney stones.</b></p></li><li><p><b>My gout has been hard to treat, taking more than a day or two to get under control and/or has required steroid pills.</b></p></li></ul><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/gout-13.html">Yes, one or more of those statements is true.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/gout-10.html">No, none of those statements are true.</a></p>
