<p>Okay. When a person with gout has joint damage seen on x-rays that seems related to gout, daily medication to lower uric acid is usually recommended. The best medication for this purpose depends in part on whether you have ever had a kidney stone or chronic kidney disease.</p><p><b>Have you had or do you have either of the following?</b></p><ul><li><p><b>kidney stone</b></p></li><li><p><b>chronic kidney disease (also called chronic renal failure, chronic renal insufficiency, etc).</b></p></li></ul><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/gout-16.html">Yes, I have had a kidney stone or have chronic kidney disease.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/gout-14.html">Nope, no kidney stones and my kidneys are fine, thanks.</a></p>
