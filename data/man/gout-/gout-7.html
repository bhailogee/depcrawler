<p>Great. The first thing to do is determine whether or not gout has been confirmed, is suspected or is actually unlikely.</p><p>The best way to prove that gout is present is to see gout crystals (actually urate crystals) under the microscope. The most common way this is done is by removing fluid from a joint through a needle. However, certain symptoms make gout very likely even without joint fluid analysis. For example, repeated episodes of severe first toe pain and swelling that resolves over a few days is very likely to be due to gout.</p><p><b>Has gout been diagnosed by analysis of joint fluid removed from one of your joints?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/gout-9.html">Yes, I had gout diagnosed through testing of joint fluid.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/gout-8.html">No, my gout was not diagnosed by testing of joint fluid.</a></p>
