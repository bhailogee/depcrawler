<p>Good! That means your gout is more likely to be mild and may not need continuous, daily treatment. You might be able take medicines &quot;as needed&quot; to treat your infrequent attacks of gout.</p><p>Here&apos;s one more question about the severity of gout. Sometimes x-rays are performed to see whether gout has caused damage (or erosions). When gout causes this joint damage, it&apos;s called a tophus which is a lump of gout crystals that can form under the skin (especially on the outside of the ear, near joints, and near the elbow) but sometimes is located within joints, causing these erosions.</p><p><b>Have you ever been told that your x-rays show gout-related joint damage or that you have tophi?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/gout-12.html">Yes, I have tophi and/or gout-related joint damage.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/gout-11.html">No, I have no tophi or gout-related joint damage.</a></p>
