					<h1>Gout</h1>
<p>The course of gout is variable but usually falls into one of a few patterns:</p><p>1) acute attacks - perhaps once or twice a year</p><p>2) frequent attacks - for example, every 2-3 months</p><p>3) chronic gout - including the development of tophi, joint damage as detected on x-rays, or long-term joint pain and swelling</p><p>4) disfiguring gout - if left untreated, large tophi may form, causing disfigurement and loss of joint function.</p><p>Treatment can alter the progression of gout from occasional sudden attacks to more chronic disease. Talk with your doctor about your diagnosis, the severity of your condition and how it is best treated.</p><p><b>Would you like to learn more about how your particular symptoms might be treated?
