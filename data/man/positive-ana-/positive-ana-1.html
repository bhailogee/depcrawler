					<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Positive ANA Decision Guide.</p><p>This decision guide is designed for persons with a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) who would like to find out more about this test and what the test result may mean.</p><p>The goal of this guide is to provide information while awaiting evaluation with your doctor, or for additional information after you have seen him or her. Please keep in mind that this guide is not intended to replace a face-to-face evaluation with your doctor. The diagnoses provided are among the most common that could explain your test results, but the list is not exhaustive and there are many other possibilities. In addition, more than one condition may be present at the same time.</p><p><b>Would you like more information about the ANA test in general, or would you rather proceed directly to what your ANA may mean?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/positive-ana-2.html">I&apos;d first rather get more general information about the ANA.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/positive-ana-3.html">I&apos;d like to learn more specific information about my ANA now.</a></p>
