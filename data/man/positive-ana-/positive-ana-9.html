					<h1>Positive ANA</h1>
<p>Sorry to hear that. Arthritis is a common symptom among persons with lupus and other conditions associated with a positive ANA, including Sjogren&apos;s syndrome and drug-induced lupus. The joint symptoms tend to affect multiple joints (more than 6), including small joints of the hand and wrist. They also tend to be symmetric, meaning pain and/or swelling is about the same on both sides of the body. Morning stiffness is common.</p><p>Chest pain or abdominal pain can represent &quot;serositis,&quot; meaning an inflammation of the lining of the lung, heart or abdominal cavity. While infections and other conditions can cause serositis, it is a relatively common development in lupus.</p><p>Similarly, a seizure disorder and/or major psychiatric disease, including psychosis (which may include delusions and hallucinations) may be observed in lupus.</p><p><b>Have you had (or been told you have) any of the following:</b></p><ul><li><p><b>kidney disease (such as kidney failure, renal failure, renal insufficiency, protein in the urine)</b></p></li><li><p><b>abnormal tendency to form blood clots, as in the legs or lungs</b></p></li><li><p><b>more than one miscarriage</b></p></li><li><p><b>anemia with red cell breakdown (also called hemolysis)</b></p></li><li><p><b>low white blood cell counts</b></p></li><li><p><b>low platelet counts?</b></p></li></ul><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/positive-ana-11.html">Yes, I have been told of one or more of those problems.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/positive-ana-10.html">No, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve had any of those.</a></p>
