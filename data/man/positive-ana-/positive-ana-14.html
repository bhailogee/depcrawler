<p>You have completed the positive ANA decision guide. We hope it has been helpful. If you want to read more about positive ANA, please return here to update your symptoms and to find more information.</p><p>If you answered yes to one or more of the prior questions about medications, symptoms, or prior tests results, your ANA may be relevant to your health and could help to diagnose a specific condition, such as lupus or drug-induced lupus. On the other hand, the ANA could have no bearing on your health because positive results are often found among healthy persons.</p><p>In summary:</p><ol><li><p>The ANA is nearly always positive in SLE but it can also be positive in healthy people.</p></li><li><p>The higher the value, the more likely it is meaningful.</p></li><li><p>Only by careful review of your symptoms, past medical history, medicines, examination and, perhaps, some additional testing, can a diagnosis be made.</p></li><li><p>If you had symptoms that led your doctor to order an ANA and those symptoms have not improved, <b>contact your doctor</b> for further evaluation.</p></li></ol>
