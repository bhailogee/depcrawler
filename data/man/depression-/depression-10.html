					<h1>Depression</h1>
<p>Sometimes a <b>medical condition</b> can be the main cause of depression or be making the symptoms of depression worse. It&apos;s important that your doctor is aware of what you are feeling, especially if you have or suspect you may have a medical condition. Your doctor&apos;s ability to evaluate these possibilities can help to determine what treatment is best.</p><p>Sometimes the illness is obvious -- for example, depression can be a symptom of heart or kidney disease, cancer, or a neurologic illness.</p><p>But from time to time, a medical illness hasn&apos;t been discovered and depression is the first thing to appear. For example, a person might have anemia or an underactive thyroid and would not know it without the help of a doctor.</p><p>A primary care physician can review health status and make sure there is no significant medical illness that could be at the root of a mood change.</p><p><b>Do you think a medical condition may be contributing to the symptoms?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/depression-12.html">Yes, it&apos;s possible.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/depression-11.html">No, I don&apos;t think so.</a></p>
