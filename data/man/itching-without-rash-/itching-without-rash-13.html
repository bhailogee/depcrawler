You could be anemic without knowing it, so if your itching continues, <b>see your doctor for evaluation.</b> A simple blood test can determine if you are iron deficient.</p><p>Here&apos;s the next question:</p><p><b>Do you have any of the following?</b></p><p><b>- Unexplained weight loss or weight gain</b></p><p><b>- Cold or heat intolerance -- for example, feeling particularly hot or cold when everyone else around you is comfortable</b></p><p><b>- Palpitations or feeling your heart race</b></p><p><b>- Persistent change in voice</b></p><p><b>- Muscle weakness</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/itching-without-rash-16.html">Yes, one or more of those is true for me.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/itching-without-rash-15.html">No, none of those apply to me.</a></p>
