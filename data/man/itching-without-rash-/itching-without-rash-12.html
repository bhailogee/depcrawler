					<h1>Itching Without Rash</h1>
<p>Congratulations! The reason we ask about this is that pregnancy is often accompanied by itching, especially as the skin over the expanding abdomen stretches. In addition, pregnant women occasionally develop a liver problem (called cholestasis) that&apos;s associated with itching. If this is the case, <b>tell your obstetrician about your symptoms right away.</b></p><p>We&apos;re nearing the end of the guide -- just a few more questions.</p><p><b>Have you ever been told you&apos;re anemic or that you should take iron?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/itching-without-rash-14.html">Yes, I have been anemic or needed iron.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/itching-without-rash-13.html">No, I&apos;m not anemic or iron deficient.</a></p>
