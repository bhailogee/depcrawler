					<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Welcome to this symptom guide about itching. We&apos;re sorry to hear you have this problem!</p><p>Itching is a common symptom and it can be caused by a number of different conditions. This guide will cover some of the most common, but it is not exhaustive -- rarer causes will not be covered. Itching, also called pruritus, is often associated with a rash, as with poison ivy. But this guide is about itching without a rash.</p><p>This guide is not intended to replace a face-to-face meeting with your doctor about these symptoms. In fact, many causes of itching require an in-person examination and testing. However, this guide may be particularly helpful while awaiting a visit to your doctor or after your initial evaluation.</p><p>Okay, let&apos;s get started.</p><p><b>Along with itching, do you have any of the following?</b></p><p><b>- Trouble breathing</b></p><p><b>- Unintentional weight loss</b></p><p><b>- Enlarging lumps (or &quot;glands&quot;) under the skin</b></p><p><b>- Reduced urination</b></p><p><b>- Yellow tinge to the eyes or skin</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/itching-without-rash-3.html">Yes, I have one or more of those.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/itching-without-rash-2.html">Nope, I have none of those.</a></p>
