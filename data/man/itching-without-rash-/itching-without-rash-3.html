For example,</p><p>- Trouble breathing could be associated with a severe allergic reaction</p><p>- Enlarging lumps (or &quot;glands&quot;) under the skin, unintentional weight loss, and itching may accompany certain types of cancer, especially Hodgkin&apos;s disease</p><p>- Reduced urination may be a symptom of chronic kidney disease (also called renal failure, renal insufficiency, or uremia). This may cause prominent itching, fatigue, and nausea as well</p><p>- Yellow tinge to the eyes or skin may indicate a liver problem or a blocked duct near the liver. The yellow discoloration is also called jaundice. Itching, even without jaundice, can be a symptom of liver disease</p><p>Given these possibilities, <b>it&apos;s important to see your doctor right away for evaluation</b><b><i>.</i></b></p><p><b>Do you want to stop the guide now?
