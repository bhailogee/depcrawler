					<h1>Itching Without Rash</h1>
<p>Well, that may explain your itching. Dry skin is a particularly common cause of itching without a rash, especially as we get older. Sometimes people have dry skin due to an underlying medical condition, such as an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) or Sjogren&apos;s syndrome (a disease that typically causes arthritis, dry eyes, and dry mouth).</p><p>Avoid baths and long showers. Use moisturizing lotions and creams liberally.</p><p>Here&apos;s a question that you might not be expecting (and may not even apply to you!):</p><p><b>Are you pregnant?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/itching-without-rash-12.html">Yes, I&apos;m pregnant!</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/itching-without-rash-11.html">No, I am not pregnant!</a></p>
