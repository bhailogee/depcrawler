					<h1>Itching Without Rash</h1>
<p>Thyroid disease could be the cause of your itching. The thyroid is a gland located just in front of the throat above the collar bone; it makes a hormone involved in the regulation of your metabolism. Although not everyone with those symptoms has thyroid problems, an overactive or underactive thyroid may be associated with one or more of those. For example, people with an underactive thyroid often complain of feeling cold all the time.</p><p>For reasons that aren&apos;t clear, itching may also accompany thyroid trouble. The good news is that thyroid disease is readily diagnosed by a simple blood test, and treatment is usually straightforward.</p><p>Okay, one last question:</p><p><b>Do you sometimes scratch out of habit or when you are under stress or feeling anxious?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/itching-without-rash-18.html">Yes, I have noticed that.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/itching-without-rash-17.html">No, that&apos;s not true for me.</a></p>
