					<h1>Itching Without Rash</h1>
<p>Sorry to hear that!</p><p>You could have a condition called &quot;aquagenic pruritus&quot; (which means water-induced itching). People with this often describe symptoms as a very unpleasant prickly, intense itching sensation that may develop with any exposure to water, including humid air or sweat. Occasionally it accompanies a blood disease called Polycythemia Vera (or P.Vera). If you have these symptoms, <b>see your doctor for evaluation and treatment.</b></p><p>Here&apos;s the next question:</p><p><b>Do you have dry skin?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/itching-without-rash-10.html">Yes, actually, my skin is dry.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/itching-without-rash-9.html">No, I don&apos;t have dry skin.</a></p>
