					<h1>Itching Without Rash</h1>
<p>You could have &quot;psychogenic pruritus,&quot; a disorder in which psychological distress or tension is relieved by scratching. Some people scratch their skin as a type of nervous habit. Over time, scratching can cause skin irritation and more itching which leads to more scratching. This cycle can be hard to break. Let your doctor know about this because he or she may be able to recommend an effective treatment to break this cycle.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/itching-without-rash-19.html">Click here to finish.</a></p>
