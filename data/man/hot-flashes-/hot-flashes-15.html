					<h1>Hot Flashes</h1>
<p>Treatment with estrogen (with or without progesterone) is the most effective way to relieve hot flashes. However, some other medications can have a benefit. <b>Speak to your doctor about using any one of these medicines</b> -- they have all been demonstrated to provide partial relief from hot flashes:</p><p>- Antidepressants -- specific medications shown to be helpful include venlafaxine (Effexor), paroxetine (Paxil), and citalopram (Celexa)</p><p>- Gabapentin (Neurontin) -- this is an anti-seizure and pain relief medication</p><p>- Megestrol acetate (Megace) -- this is a progesterone medicine</p><p>- Clonidine -- this is a blood pressure medicine</p><p>Natural therapies for hot flashes are not very effective. Even so, it has been estimated that 50% to 75% of postmenopausal women use these treatments. Studies about these treatments have been disappointing; none of the most commonly used natural therapies for hot flashes have been shown to have a convincing benefit. These commonly used products include soy products, phytoestrogens (plant estrogens), black cohosh, red clover, isoflavones, flaxseed, ginseng, Dong quai, evening primrose oil, acupuncture, wild yam, and vitamin E.</p>
