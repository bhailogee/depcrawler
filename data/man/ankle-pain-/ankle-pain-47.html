					<h1>Ankle Pain</h1>
<p>From your answers (mild pain, no fever, pain for at least three weeks, no swelling or morning stiffness, but with pain in other joints), a number of conditions could explain your pain:</p><p>Osteoarthritis is a common cause of joint pain in persons over age 50 or if there has been previous injury or arthritis.</p><p>Fibromyalgia, an underactive thyroid or a problem with calcium levels can cause pain in multiple joints and/or muscles without swelling.</p><p>If there is swelling in the other painful joints, rheumatoid arthritis, or a related condition, comes to mind, although there is usually morning stiffness in these disorders.</p><p>There are other possibilities (if you can believe it!) and you could have more than one cause of joint pain; early treatment is important for many of these, so it is important that you <b>see your doctor soon for evaluation.</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/ankle-pain-51.html">Click here for more ankle pain information</a></p>
