					<h1>Ankle Pain</h1>
<p>From your answers (ankle pain for less than three weeks that is neither mild nor severe, without fever, swelling or morning stiffness, but with other painful joints), a number of conditions come to mind.</p><p>A sprain or tendonitis could cause these symptoms, but would not explain pain in the other joints.</p><p>Fibromyalgia, an underactive thyroid or too much calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) can cause pain in multiple joints and/or muscles without swelling.</p><p>Osteoarthritis could do this, especially if you are over the age of 50 or have had previous injuries to that ankle. This type of arthritis often affects the neck, low back, hips, knees, and hands.</p><p>Ankle arthritis may accompany conditions causing arthritis in other parts of the body (such as rheumatoid arthritis) but there is usually swelling and prominent morning stiffness.</p><p>There are other possibilities (if you can believe it!) and early treatment is important for many of these, so it is important that you <b>see your doctor</b> soon for evaluation.</p><p>If your ankle pain is already improving, you may just need to give it a bit more time; over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines (such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen) are reasonable to try unless you are already taking them or your doctor has told you to avoid these. If symptoms persist, <b>see your doctor</b> for evaluation.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/ankle-pain-51.html">Click here for more ankle pain information</a></p>
