					<h1>Ankle Pain</h1>
<p>Although your symptoms could be related to a sprain or other minor injury, this would not explain your other joint pains. The absence of prominent morning stiffness argues against significant inflammation in the ankle. Swelling without much inflammation may be a sign of osteoarthritis, sprain or fracture. If you have other swollen and painful joints that <b>are</b> particularly stiff in the morning, rheumatoid arthritis or a related condition are possible causes of your symptoms. However, symptoms should be present for at least six weeks before this diagnosis can be made with confidence. Sarcoidosis is another cause of ankle pain, though there is often swelling in or near the joint and a rash (called erythema nodosum) commonly accompanies the ankle pain.</p><p>Finally, a joint infection, such as Lyme disease, could be the cause.</p><p>There are other possibilities (if you can believe it!) and early treatment is important for many of these, so it is important that you <b>see your doctor soon for evaluation.</b> See the next page for more information about specific causes of ankle pain.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/ankle-pain-51.html">Click here for more ankle pain information</a></p>
