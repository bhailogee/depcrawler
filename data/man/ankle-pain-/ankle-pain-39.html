					<h1>Ankle Pain</h1>
<p>From your answers (mild ankle pain without fever or swelling, lasting at least three weeks, no other painful joints, without morning stiffness), a number of conditions come to mind.</p><p>A sprain could cause these symptoms.</p><p>Osteoarthritis could do this, especially if you are over the age of 50 or have had previous injuries to that ankle.</p><p>Gout can cause pain and swelling in one ankle, though it&apos;s usually very painful.</p><p>There are other possibilities (if you can believe it!) and early treatment is important for many of these, so it is important that you <b>see your doctor soon for evaluation.</b></p><p>If your ankle pain is already improving, you may just need to give it a bit more time; over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines (such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen) are reasonable to try unless you are already taking them or your doctor has told you to avoid these. If symptoms persist, <b>see your doctor</b> for evaluation.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/ankle-pain-51.html">Click here for more ankle pain information</a></p>
