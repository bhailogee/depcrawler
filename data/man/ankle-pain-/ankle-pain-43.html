					<h1>Ankle Pain</h1>
<p>From your answers, (mild ankle pain, no fever, for at least three weeks, with swelling and morning stiffness, but no other joint pain), a number of conditions come to mind.</p><p>An ankle sprain or tendonitis can cause pain and swelling, though prominent stiffness in the morning would be a bit unusual.</p><p>Ankle arthritis could cause this, and a number of specific disorders that commonly cause ankle arthritis are listed on the next page. If you have psoriasis, Crohn&apos;s disease, ulcerative colitis, or prominent low back pain, for example, conditions on the next page may be of particular importance to you.</p><p>Infection in the joint, including Lyme disease, is a possibility, though not as common as other possibilities.</p><p>There are other possibilities (if you can believe it!) and early treatment is important for many of these, so it is important that you <b>see your doctor soon for evaluation.</b></p><p>If your ankle pain is already improving, you may just need to give it a bit more time; over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines (such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen) are reasonable to try unless you are already taking them or your doctor has told you to avoid these. If symptoms persist, <b>see your doctor</b> for evaluation.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/ankle-pain-51.html">Click here for more ankle pain information</a></p>
