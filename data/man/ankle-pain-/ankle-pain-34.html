					<h1>Ankle Pain</h1>
<p>From your answers (ankle pain for less than three weeks that is neither mild nor severe, without fever, but with swelling, other painful joints, and morning stiffness), a number of conditions come to mind.</p><p>A sprain could cause these symptoms, but would not explain pain in the other joints.</p><p>Osteoarthritis could do this, especially if you are over the age of 50 or have had previous injuries to that ankle. This type of arthritis often affects the neck, low back, hips, knees, and hands.</p><p>Ankle arthritis may accompany conditions causing arthritis in other parts of the body (such as rheumatoid arthritis), and there is typically swelling in these other joints as well.</p><p>Gout can cause pain and swelling in one ankle, though it&apos;s usually very painful; gout occasionally affects more than one joint but even then it&apos;s only a few joints. Joint infection (including Lyme disease) is a relatively rare cause of ankle pain such as yours.</p><p>There are other possibilities (if you can believe it!) and early treatment is important for many of these, so it is important that you <b>see your doctor soon for evaluation.</b></p><p>If your ankle pain is already improving, you may just need to give it a bit more time; over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines (such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen) are reasonable to try unless you are already taking them or your doctor has told you to avoid these. If symptoms persist, <b>see your doctor</b> for evaluation.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/ankle-pain-51.html">Click here for more ankle pain information</a></p>
