					<h1>Ankle Pain</h1>
<p>From your answers (ankle pain for less than three weeks that is neither mild nor severe, without fever and without other joint pains or swelling but with morning stiffness), a number of conditions come to mind.</p><p>A sprain or tendonitis could cause these symptoms.</p><p>Osteoarthritis could do this, especially if you are over the age of 50 or have had previous injuries to that ankle. Pain is usually worse with walking.</p><p>Fibromyalgia, an underactive thyroid or too much calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) can cause pain in multiple joints and/or muscles without swelling.</p><p>Ankle arthritis may accompany conditions causing arthritis in other parts of the body (such as rheumatoid arthritis) but there is usually pain in other joints and swelling; past psoriasis, diarrhea or a sexually transmitted disease may be of particular importance to you (see arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis or Reiter&apos;s syndrome).</p><p>There are other possibilities (if you can believe it!) and early treatment is important for many of these, so it is important that you <b>see your doctor soon for evaluation.</b></p><p>If your ankle pain is already improving, you may just need to give a bit more time; over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines (such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen) are reasonable to try unless you are already taking them or your doctor has told you to avoid these. If symptoms persist, <b>see your doctor</b> for evaluation.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/ankle-pain-51.html">Click here for more ankle pain information</a></p>
