					<h1>Ankle Pain</h1>
<p>Although your symptoms could be related to a sprain or other minor injury, this would not explain your other joint pains. Morning stiffness and swelling are common signs of joint inflammation (arthritis). If you have other similarly swollen and painful joints that are particularly stiff in the morning, rheumatoid arthritis is a possible cause of your symptoms. However, symptoms should be present for at least six weeks before this diagnosis can be made with confidence. Other possible causes include sarcoidosis, ankylosing spondylitis (especially if you have prominent back pain), or a related condition.</p><p>If you have had past episodes of swelling that came up suddenly and resolved quickly, gout would be a consideration (especially if you are male or a woman over age 55).</p><p>Finally, a joint infection, such as Lyme disease, could be the cause.</p><p>There are other possibilities (if you can believe it!) and early treatment is important for many of these, so it is important that you <b>see your doctor soon for evaluation.</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/ankle-pain-51.html">Click here for more ankle pain information</a></p>
