					<h1>Ankle Pain</h1>
<p>Okay, just to review: your ankle pain is not mild, there&apos;s no associated fever, it&apos;s been going on for less than three weeks with swelling and no other joints are painful.</p><p>Just one more question:</p><p><b>Is your ankle pain worse in the morning for at least 30 minutes?</b> Another way to ask this is: <b>Does it take at least 30 minutes for your ankle to get as good as it&apos;s going to get for the rest of the day?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/ankle-pain-27.html">Yes, I have morning stiffness.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/ankle-pain-26.html">No, I don&apos;t have prominent morning stiffness.</a></p>
