					<h1>Ankle Pain</h1>
<p>From your answers (ankle pain for at least three weeks that is neither mild nor severe, without morning stiffness, fever, pain in other joints or swelling), a number of conditions come to mind.</p><p>A sprain or tendonitis could cause ankle pain like yours.</p><p>Osteoarthritis could do this, especially if you are over the age of 50 or have had previous injuries to that ankle. Ankle pain in this condition is usually worse with walking.</p><p>There are other possibilities (if you can believe it!) and early treatment is important for many of these, so it is important that you <b>see your doctor soon for evaluation.</b></p><p>If your ankle pain is already improving, you may just need to give it a bit more time; over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines (such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen) are reasonable to try unless you are already taking them or your doctor has told you to avoid these. If symptoms persist, <b>see your doctor</b> for evaluation.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/ankle-pain-51.html">Click here for more ankle pain information</a></p>
