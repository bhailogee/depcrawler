					<h1>Ankle Pain</h1>
<p>So, your pain is not severe (at least it is not affecting your function), you have no fever, and it&apos;s been going on for less than three weeks.</p><p>Your ankle pain is probably due to a mild strain or sprain, even if you cannot recall a specific trigger or injury.</p><p>Unless you have been instructed to avoid these medicines, it would be reasonable to take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve), rest the ankle, keep it elevated and wrapped and it may get better on its own. If it is not getting better, or if it gets worse, <b>contact your doctor</b> for evaluation.</p>
