<p>You can help to prevent dry skin by taking these steps</p><ul><li><p>Take only one shower or bath daily. Wash with comfortably warm (not hot) water, using a soap that either has a high fat content or contains glycerin. Limit your bath time to ten to 15 minutes, and avoid scrubbing.</p></li><li><p>If you are an athlete, shower off quickly after a workout or game. Use warm water, and bring your own mild soap, since heavy-duty &quot;gym&quot; brands may be too strong.</p></li><li><p>When you finish your bath or shower, apply moisturizer while your skin is still wet. Petroleum jelly or a thick cream is best for sealing skin moisture.</p></li><li><p>Cover exposed skin when you play outdoors. If you can&apos;t wear protective clothing because of hot weather or game regulations, apply a sunscreen with a moisturizer. If you are a swimmer, apply a light layer of petroleum jelly before you enter the pool.</p></li><li><p>If your indoor air is dry during winter months, use a humidifier to raise the humidity level.</p></li><li><p>As necessary during the day, apply a moisturizer that contains at least one of the following ingredients: glycerin, urea, pyroglutamic acid, sorbitol, lactic acid, lactate salts or alpha hydroxy acids.</p></li><li><p>Avoid overusing antiperspirants and perfumes, since these products can dry the skin.</p></li></ul><p><b>Call your primary-care doctor or a dermatologist</b> (a doctor who specializes in skin problems) if you have</p><ul><li><p>dry skin that doesn&apos;t respond to non-prescription treatments</p></li><li><p>severe itching that interferes with your ability to work or sleep</p></li><li><p>dry skin that cracks and bleeds, or becomes red, swollen and painful.</p></li></ul><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/helping-dry-skin-4.html">Treating dry skin</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/helping-dry-skin-6.html">I&apos;d like to learn more about my own specific situation.</a></p>
