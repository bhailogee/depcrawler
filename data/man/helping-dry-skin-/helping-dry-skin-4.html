<p><b>Moisturizers (emollients)</b> help those suffering from dry skin conditions, such as eczema, dermatitis or psoriasis. Emollients work to restore moisture by trapping water in the skin and creating a barrier on the skin&apos;s surface to prevent further water loss. Moisturizers come in many different forms -- creams, lotions, bath oils and ointments.</p><p>After bathing, gently pat the skin with a towel and immediately apply a good moisturizer (emollient) to your slightly wet skin. This helps to seal in the moisture. If you have excessive scaling and flaking of the skin, apply a lotion that contains an alpha hydroxy acid. Petroleum jelly or a thick cream is best for sealing skin moisture.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/helping-dry-skin-5.html">Conditions related to dry skin</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/helping-dry-skin-6.html">I&apos;d like to learn more about my own specific situation.</a></p>
