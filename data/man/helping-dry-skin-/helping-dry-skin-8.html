<p>Try moisturizing the skin well first.</p><p>If there is continued itching or flaking (pruritus), you may have eczema. Eczema refers to several conditions that share a pattern of changes in the surface of the skin. Eczema first appears as an episode of itching, redness and tiny bumps or blisters. When it develops into a long-term condition (chronic eczema), it leads to skin thickening, scaling, flaking, dryness and color changes.</p><p>If you have eczema and your skin is sensitive and itchy, avoid using soaps and moisturizers that are scented. Also, using a very emollient but non-irritating moisturizer such as hydrated petrolatum (Hydro latum) is beneficial.</p><p>To relieve dry, itchy skin, try an over-the-counter topical steroid, such as&#xA0;one percent hydrocortisone cream or ointment. If the skin continues to be itchy, red or scaly after two weeks of use, consult your doctor.</p><p>Your doctor will review your skin-care routine and might prescribe a stronger corticosteroid ointment or cream for you to use on the affected area. To relieve itching, your doctor also may prescribe an antihistamine to take by mouth.</p><p>Hot baths and showers can wash away your skin&apos;s protective sebum, leaving your skin dry and irritated. Scrubbing rather than gently massaging your skin surface can be very drying, especially if you use harsh soaps.</p><p><b>Do you frequently</b></p><ul><li><p><b>take long, hot baths or showers, or</b></p></li><li><p><b>scrub your skin surface with harsh soaps?</b></p></li></ul><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/helping-dry-skin-10.html">Yes, one or both of these apply to me.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/helping-dry-skin-9.html">No, I don&apos;t do either.</a></p>
