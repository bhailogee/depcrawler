This is most often a temporary situation, but it could suggest a more persistent or recurrent disorder.</p><p><b>Do you have ringing in the ear or loss of hearing associated with the dizziness?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/new-onset-dizziness-47.html">Yes, I have one or both of these symptoms.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/new-onset-dizziness-46.html">No, I have neither.</a></p>
