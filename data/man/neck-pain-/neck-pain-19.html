<p>Each person&apos;s neck pain is different and each person responds to pain differently, so review with your doctor which may work best for you.</p><p>The <u>medications</u> that may help include:</p><ul><li><p>over-the-counter medication for pain such as acetaminophen, or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen or naproxen</p></li><li><p>an ointment or cream applied to the painful area, such as Icy-hot or BenGay</p></li><li><p>prescription medicines such as&#xA0;muscle relaxants (diazepam, cyclobenzaprine, or methocarbamol) and higher doses of ibuprofen and naproxen</p></li><li><p>powerful pain relievers, such as narcotics (codeine, propoxyphene, oxycodone and others); side effects, such as sedation, constipation and nausea, are common and limit the use of these; they are also habit forming, so low doses and short duration of use are recommended if these medications are prescribed</p></li><li><p>tramadol (Ultram), a non-narcotic medication that acts in a similar way to narcotic medicines</p></li><li><p>injections of cortisone and long-acting anesthetic agents; these are occasionally offered for certain causes of neck pain (such as osteoarthritis, disk disease or spinal stenosis).</p></li></ul><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/neck-pain-20.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
