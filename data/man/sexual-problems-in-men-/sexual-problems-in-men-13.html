					<h1>Sexual Problems in Men</h1>
<p>Diabetes can produce nerve damage all over the body, including the nerves that control sexual function. Nerve damage is particularly likely if your diabetes is poorly controlled.</p><p><b>Talk to your doctor.</b> Working to bring your diabetes under good control can help to prevent further nerve damage, and may even help to reverse nerve damage that has already occurred.</p><p>Keep in mind that retrograde ejaculation is a harmless problem. Only men who are having fertility problems need to be treated. If you find the condition to be bothersome or the lack of semen interferes with your sexual pleasure, you can talk to your doctor about certain medications (such as the decongestant pseudoephedrine) that may improve your symptoms.</p>
