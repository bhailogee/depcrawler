					<h1>Sexual Problems in Men</h1>
<p><b>Talk to your doctor.</b> Your difficulty reaching orgasm may be caused by the medication you are taking. In some cases, this problem can be fixed by stopping or switching your medication. <b>However, do not stop your medication without speaking to your doctor first.</b></p><p>If your difficulty with orgasms is caused by an SSRI drug, the symptoms may also improve with the addition of a second antidepressant called buproprion (Wellbutrin).</p>
