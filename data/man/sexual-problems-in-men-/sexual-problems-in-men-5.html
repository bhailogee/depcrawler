					<h1>Sexual Problems in Men</h1>
<p>A &quot;dry&quot; orgasm is usually caused by a condition called retrograde ejaculation. In this condition, semen leaves the prostate gland, but then travels backward (retrograde) into the bladder instead of out through the urethra. Semen then leaves the body mixed with urine the next time the bladder is emptied.</p><p>Many men are disturbed by dry orgasms, but the condition is not harmful. Medical treatment is needed only if retrograde ejaculation interferes with a man&apos;s fertility.</p><p>Retrograde ejaculation can develop for a number of different reasons, including</p><ul><li><p>nerve damage caused by medical conditions or surgery</p></li><li><p>damage to the prostate or bladder from surgery</p></li><li><p>side effects from medications.</p></li></ul><p>To find out why you may be having retrograde ejaculation, let&apos;s start off by asking some questions about your medical history.
