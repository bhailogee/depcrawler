<p>Many men will notice that their sex drive (libido) goes up and down over time. They may be less interested in sex when they are tired, distracted, ill, or depressed. Relationship issues can also affect sex drive. Fortunately, sex drive tends to return to normal when these problems go away.</p><p>However, some men can experience a lasting decrease in sex drive that they found worrisome or bothersome. Low sex drive itself can also affect a man&apos;s relationship with his partner.</p><p>In the majority of cases, persistent low sex drive comes from stress or other psychological issues.
