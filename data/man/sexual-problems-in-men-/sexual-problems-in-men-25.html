					<h1>Sexual Problems in Men</h1>
<p>Although many men are surprised to hear it, curvature of the penis is not a rare problem. Some men are born with a penis that bends slightly when it becomes erect, but other men develop a bend that worsens over time. This can interfere with sexual activity.</p><p>Men who develop curvature of the penis in middle age which worsens over time have a condition known as Peyronie&apos;s disease. In addition to the curve, Peyronie&apos;s disease can cause impotence (erectile dysfunction) and pain.</p><p>While no treatments have been proven to prevent Peyronie&apos;s, many men with this disease will notice that it does not worsen, or may even improve, over time. Many men don&apos;t require treatment, but you should <b>contact your doctor</b> if you notice any of the following symptoms:</p><ul><li><p>a bend in your erection that prevents intercourse</p></li><li><p>painful or uncomfortable lumps along the shaft of the penis</p></li><li><p>difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection.</p></li></ul>
