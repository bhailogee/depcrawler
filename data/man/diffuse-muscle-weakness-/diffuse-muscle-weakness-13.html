					<h1>Diffuse Muscle Weakness</h1>
<p>Okay, good. Just one more question:</p><p><b>Has your weakness been something you&apos;ve noticed all your life?</b> For example, were you able to keep up with the other kids on the playground? Have you had trouble getting up from a squatting position ever since you were a child?</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/diffuse-muscle-weakness-16.html">Yes, I&apos;ve had weakness problems all my life.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/diffuse-muscle-weakness-15.html">No, those are not problems I&apos;ve had.</a></p>
