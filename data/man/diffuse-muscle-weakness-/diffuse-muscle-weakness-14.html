<p>Conditions that cause weakness of facial muscles include myasthenia gravis, Bell&apos;s palsy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also called Lou Gehrig&apos;s Disease), among other conditions. <b>See your doctor</b> and describe as precisely as you can the facial muscle symptoms you are having.</p><p>Just one more question:</p><p><b>Has your weakness been something you&apos;ve noticed all your life? For example, were you able to keep up with the other kids on the playground? Have you had trouble getting up from a squatting position ever since you were a child?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/diffuse-muscle-weakness-16.html">Yes, I&apos;ve had weakness problems all my life.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/diffuse-muscle-weakness-15.html">No, those are not problems I&apos;ve had.</a></p>
