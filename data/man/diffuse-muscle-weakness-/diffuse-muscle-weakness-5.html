					<h1>Diffuse Muscle Weakness</h1>
<p>Okay. There are a number of reasons that these muscles may become weak. Certain medications can do it, and that&apos;s one of the most common causes. While there&apos;s a long list of medications that occasionally cause muscle weakness, the most common are corticosteroids (such as prednisone), statin-type cholesterol-lowering medicines (such as lovastatin, simvastatin or atorvastatin), and the anti-HIV drug, AZT (also called zidovudine or azidothymidine).</p><p><b>Have you started any new medications lately? Are you taking a corticosteroid medication, a statin, or AZT?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/diffuse-muscle-weakness-7.html">Yes, I take one of those or just started a new medicine.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/diffuse-muscle-weakness-6.html">Nope, no new medicines and none of those you mention.</a></p>
