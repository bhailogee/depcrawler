					<h1>Daytime Drowsiness</h1>
<p>Three of the more common reasons for difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep are insomnia, depression, and sleep apnea. Insomnia is easy to recognize, but diagnosing the other two disorders may be less obvious. For instance, sadness may not be a prominent feature of depression and the person experiencing sleep problems will often not recognize that depression is the problem.</p><p>With sleep apnea, the person may wake up many times during the night without being aware of it. Heavy snoring is a predominant feature of sleep apnea. The person with the disorder may not know that they snore, but his or her partner will hear it.</p><p>If you suspect that you may have a sleep disorder, contact your doctor.</p>
