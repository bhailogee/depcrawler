A prescription nasal spray containing a corticosteroid is another treatment that may help, and some people benefit from using the oral medicine montelukast (Singulair).</p><p><b>Contact your doctor if your cough does not completely resolve with over-the-counter antihistamine-decongestant products.</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-cough-14.html">Click here if you want to learn about other reasons for persistent cough.</a></p>
