					<h1>Persistent Cough</h1>
<p>You don&apos;t have the most obvious symptoms of acid reflux, but you should not discount reflux as a possible cause of your symptoms. By one study&apos;s estimate, 40% of people who have a persistent cough that is caused by reflux have their cough without a sour taste and without heartburn.</p><p>Your symptoms don&apos;t give us obvious clues that direct us to one of the most common causes of a persistent cough. A cough that has persisted for longer than 8 weeks should be evaluated by your doctor, and it is reasonable to have a chest x-ray.</p><p>Your cough could be coming from one of the common causes that we have already reviewed, even though you don&apos;t have obvious associated symptoms. This is true for most people who have a persistent cough. Among non-smokers who have a normal chest x-ray and who do not take a medicine in the ACE-inhibitor group, 99.4% of persistent coughs arise from either post-nasal drip (or other upper airway irritation), asthma, or GERD (reflux).</p><p>You and your doctor can consider treatments for one or more of the common causes to see if your cough improves. Your doctor can also consider rare causes of a persistent cough, with a complete physical exam and additional tests if these seem reasonable.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-cough-19.html">Click here to review rare causes of a persistent cough.</a></p>
