If your cough is not easily explained by another diagnosis, your doctor may test you for asthma with breathing tests called &quot;spirometry.&quot; Your doctor may also choose to try out an inhaler that is used to treat asthma to see if this relieves your symptoms.</p><p>One important trigger of a persistent cough is acid reflux from the stomach (which is known as gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD).</p><p><b>Do you have a recurring sour taste in your mouth, or do you frequently notice burning pain (called heartburn) behind your breastbone (sternum)?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-cough-20.html">Yes, I have symptoms that suggest acid reflux.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-cough-16.html">No, I don&apos;t have acid reflux symptoms.</a></p>
