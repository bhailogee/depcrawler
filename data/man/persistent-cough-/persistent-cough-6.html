					<h1>Persistent Cough</h1>
<p>Excellent. Congratulations on your good decision to not smoke.</p><p>It is possible that your cough is from a commonly prescribed medicine:</p><p>Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, commonly called ACE inhibitors, are frequently prescribed to treat hypertension, heart disease, and kidney problems related to diabetes. Examples of medicines in this group are lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), benazepril (Lotensin), enalapril (Vasotec), fosinopril (Monopril), moexipril (Univasc), quinapril (Accupril), ramipril (Altace), and trandolapril (Mavik).</p><p>ACE inhibitors cause slightly adjusted chemistry in the airways, and they trigger a dry persistent cough in a small fraction of people who use these medicines. The cough usually starts during the first month that the medicine is initiated, but it can occasionally begin much later.</p><p><b>Do you take an ACE inhibitor medicine?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-cough-10.html">Yes, I take an ACE inhibitor.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-cough-9.html">No, I don&apos;t take an ACE inhibitor.</a></p>
