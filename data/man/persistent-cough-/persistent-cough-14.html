					<h1>Persistent Cough</h1>
<p>Another very common cause of persistent cough is asthma. Usually asthma causes a fairly obvious wheezing noise with your breathing (this can sound like a harmonica note or a raspy noise), and it causes you to feel short of breath.</p><p><b>Do you sometimes make a wheezing noise or feel short of breath?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-cough-17.html">Yes, I do wheeze or feel short of breath.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-cough-15.html">No, I don&apos;t wheeze or feel short of breath.</a></p>
