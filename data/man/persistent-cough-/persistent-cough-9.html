<p>One of the most common triggers for a cough is mucus draining down the back of the throat, called post-nasal drip.</p><p>Allergic rhinitis (also called hay fever) can cause post-nasal drip with a cough. Some people also produce clear nasal mucus with no allergy trigger, reacting to temperature change or irritants in the air. Nasal symptoms with no allergy trigger are sometimes named &quot;vasomotor rhinitis.&quot;</p><p>Symptoms that suggest post-nasal drip as a likely cause of your cough might include:</p><p>- Frequent nose dripping or discharge</p><p>- A frequent need to clear your throat</p><p>- A feeling of liquid dripping into the back of the throat</p><p>- Nasal congestion</p><p>- Allergy symptoms such as sneezing or itchy, red eyes</p><p><b>Do you have any of these symptoms, which are suggestive for post-nasal drip?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-cough-13.html">Yes, I have symptoms that suggest post-nasal drip.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-cough-12.html">No, I don&apos;t have these symptoms.</a></p>
