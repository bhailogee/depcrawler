					<h1>Persistent Cough</h1>
<p>Most people are not concerned about a cough when it first begins, since it is so common to have a cough from a cold or viral bronchitis. At the start of your cough, you may also have had a dripping or congested nose, sore throat, fever, muscle aches, nausea, ear pain, or pink eye. Sometimes bronchitis or other upper respiratory infections result in a long-lasting cough.</p><p><b>When your cough began, did you have any other symptoms that suggest that you had a cold, bronchitis or a viral illness?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-cough-3.html">Yes, I had some or all of these symptoms.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/persistent-cough-5.html">No, I didn&apos;t have any symptoms like that.</a></p>
