					<h1>Jaundice in Adults</h1>
<p>Your medicine or herbal supplement is not the most likely explanation for your jaundice, but it is a good idea for you to discuss what you&apos;re taking with your doctor at your visit. </p><p></p><p>Some of the most common causes of jaundice are gallstones (with blockage of the common bile duct and infection, which requires immediate treatment), alcoholic injury to the liver, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, cancer, and autoimmune problems. </p><p></p><p><b>You should be evaluated by a physician, such as your primary care doctor or a doctor in an emergency department, as soon as possible. </b> Your evaluation will probably begin with blood tests and a look at the liver using an ultrasound of the abdomen.  </p>
