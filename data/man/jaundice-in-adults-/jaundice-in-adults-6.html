					<h1>Jaundice in Adults</h1>
<p>The most dangerous condition that can cause your symptoms is cholangitis, also called ascending cholangitis. This is a bacterial infection in the ducts (drainage tubes) that deliver bile towards the gall bladder. Usually  cholangitis  results when a gallstone or scar from prior surgery blocks smooth drainage of bile, allowing an infection to take hold within the bile fluid.  Cholangitis  is treatable with antibiotics. It requires hospitalization because it is an infection that can be life-threatening without appropriate treatment. </p><p></p><p>Cholangitis  usually causes fever or pain in the right upper abdomen, in addition to jaundice. We can consider other problems in addition to  cholangitis  that might be responsible for your symptoms. </p><p></p><p>Weight loss could be a sign that your illness began a long while ago, before your jaundice appeared. </p><p></p><p><b>Have you unexpectedly lost weight in the last several months?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/jaundice-in-adults-24.html">Yes, I have been losing weight.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/jaundice-in-adults-7.html">No, I have not lost weight.</a></p>
