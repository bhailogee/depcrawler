<p>Hepatitis A is a virus that is spread from infected people through contaminated sewage or stool. People are at risk for  hepatitis  A infection if they eat shellfish taken from waters where raw sewage may have drained. You are also at risk if you have eaten foods that were contaminated while they were growing (by contaminated fertilizer), while they were harvested and processed, or while they were prepared (contaminated food and water is a common problem in developing countries). People who work with small (diapered) children in a daycare center are also at risk, if another child in the center carries the infection.  </p><p></p><p><b>Do you have concern about possible recent exposure to hepatitis A?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/jaundice-in-adults-18.html">Yes, I work in a daycare center.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/jaundice-in-adults-17.html">Yes, I may eaten contaminated food.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/jaundice-in-adults-14.html">No, I don&apos;t have a reason to be concerned about hepatitis A.</a></p>
