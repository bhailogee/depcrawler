					<h1>Jaundice in Adults</h1>
<p>It is very concerning that you have experienced recent weight loss and now have jaundice. Cancer is a realistic worry in a person with your symptoms. There are many cancers that can cause jaundice by blocking the flow of bile out of the liver. Examples are pancreatic cancer, cancer of the gallbladder ducts, liver cancer, and cancer that can spread (metastasize) to the liver, such as colon or breast cancer. </p><p></p><p>A viral infection or autoimmune disease could also explain your symptoms. </p><p></p><p>Your evaluation will probably begin with blood tests and a look at the liver using a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen. </p>
