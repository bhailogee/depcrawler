<p>Hepatitis B can be spread through sexual contact. Your sexual experience may have put you at risk for hepatitis if you have ever had a sexually transmitted infection (gonorrhea, Chlamydia, herpes, or any other). You are also at risk if you have had unprotected sex (sex without a condom) with several different partners, or if you have had a sexual partner with a high-risk history. </p><p></p><p>Currently, vaccination against hepatitis B is available. For people who do not have a stable, monogamous partner, vaccination is advisable. </p><p></p><p><b>Do you have a sexual history that may have put you at risk for hepatitis B exposure?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/jaundice-in-adults-19.html">Yes, I may have had a high-risk sexual exposure.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/jaundice-in-adults-13.html">No, this is not a concern for me.</a></p>
