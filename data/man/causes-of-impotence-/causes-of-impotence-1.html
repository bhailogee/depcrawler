					<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Welcome to this Decision Guide on Causes of Impotence.</p><p>Impotence is when a man has difficulty getting or maintaining an erection. Impotence is also known as erectile dysfunction, or ED. Recent studies show that impotence is a much more common problem than once believed. Many younger men may experience difficulty with erections, and as many as two-thirds of men will develop impotence at some point in their lives.</p><p>Recent studies are also changing our notion about why men develop impotence. While it was once believed that psychological problems were the main cause, we now understand that medical factors -- such as poor blood flow, nerve damage, and medication side effects -- play an important role in most cases of impotence.</p><p>This guide is intended to help you understand why you may be experiencing impotence. Keep in mind that <b>you should be evaluated by a health care professional</b> if you have persistent symptoms. Our goal is to provide useful information while you are awaiting further evaluation, or&#xA0;add to what you may have already learned at your visit with a doctor. Remember that this guide cannot substitute for an individual evaluation by your health care provider.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/causes-of-impotence-2.html">Click here to begin.</a></p>
