					<h1>Causes of Impotence</h1>
<p>Impotence linked to heart or vascular disease may or may not improve with time. However, drugs used to treat impotence may be particularly effective in men who have this type of problem. Please visit our Decision Guide on Treatment of Impotence.</p><p>Regardless of whether you would like treatment, men with impotence and one of these underlying conditions should <b>contact their doctor</b>. That&apos;s because impotence can be a sign of poor blood flow to other important organs, including the heart. Your doctor may recommend a medical evaluation, including measurement of your blood pressure and cholesterol, and tests to ensure that your heart is working normally.</p>
