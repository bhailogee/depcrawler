					<h1>Causes of Impotence</h1>
<p>Your difficulty with erections may be the result of damage from your surgery. If the surgery was performed recently, your symptoms may improve with time. Otherwise, impotence is likely to continue in the future. Talk to your surgeon about your symptoms and about the possibility that the surgery contributed to your impotence. There may be more than one cause, so even if you had one of these operations, your impotence could be unrelated. That&apos;s important, because the choice of treatment and the chances of success may depend on identifying all of the possible contributors to this problem.</p><p>You may be helped by one or more treatment available to improve problems with erections. Please visit our Decision Guide on Treatment of Impotence.</p>
