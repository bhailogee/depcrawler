<p>Mineral oil helps to soften the stool and make it easier to come out. It does not have any taste and usually is mixed in with other foods. Some children do not like the way it feels (texture). Mineral oil should never be given to children younger than one year of age or children with swallowing difficulties or reflux, unless directed by a doctor, because it can damage the lungs if it is inhaled while drinking.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-chronic-constipation-in-children-40.html">Click here for information on milk of magnesia.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-chronic-constipation-in-children-41.html">Click here for information on lactulose or sorbitol.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-chronic-constipation-in-children-42.html">Click here for information on polyethylene glycol (Miralax).</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-chronic-constipation-in-children-43.html">Click here for information on senna and bisadocyl.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-chronic-constipation-in-children-44.html">Click here to exit this guide.</a></p>
