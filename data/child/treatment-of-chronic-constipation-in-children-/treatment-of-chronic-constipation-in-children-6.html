					<h1>Treatment of Chronic Constipation in Children</h1>
<p>In general, it is not good for children to drink too much juice because it is high in sugar and calories, which can cause cavities and unnecessary weight gain. However, children with constipation should drink some juice every day. The fruit sugars (sorbitol) in juice help to make your child&apos;s stools softer and more frequent. In fact, when toddlers drink too much juice, they often get diarrhea (lots of soft stools).</p><p>Prune, pear and apple juice are the best (in that order) for helping to soften stools. Encourage your child to drink four to eight ounces of these juices every day.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-chronic-constipation-in-children-8.html">What about milk?</a></p>
