<p>Senna (for example, Senokot) and bisadocyl (Dulcolax) are motivating laxatives. They should not be used for prolonged periods.</p><p>For various reasons, these treatment options do not work for every child. If your child has repeated problems with constipation, you may be referred to a gastroenterologist, a doctor who specializes in problems with the gastrointestinal (stomach and colon) system.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-chronic-constipation-in-children-39.html">Click here for information on mineral oil.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-chronic-constipation-in-children-40.html">Click here for information on milk of magnesia.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-chronic-constipation-in-children-41.html">Click here for information on lactulose or sorbitol.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-chronic-constipation-in-children-42.html">Click here for information on polyethylene glycol (Miralax).</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-chronic-constipation-in-children-44.html">Click here to exit this guide.</a></p>
