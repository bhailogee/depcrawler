					<h1>Fever in Children</h1>
<p>You&apos;ve said that your child has a fever and stomachache, but no cough, runny nose, sore throat, problems with urination, vomiting or diarrhea.</p><p>It&apos;s hard to say exactly what is causing your child&apos;s fever. It may be a viral illness--or he may just be too early yet in his illness for him to have other symptoms.</p><p><b>If he has a high fever (more than 102F or 39C), has a bad stomachache, is acting weak or otherwise very sick, call your doctor immediately for advice</b>. If not, have him rest and give him plenty of fluids. You can use acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever; read the dosing directions on the package carefully.</p><p>If he develops other symptoms, you may want to do this decision guide again. Call your doctor if he&apos;s getting worse, or if he doesn&apos;t improve in a day or two.</p>
