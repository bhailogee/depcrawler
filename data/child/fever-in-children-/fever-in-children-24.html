					<h1>Fever in Children</h1>
<p>You&apos;ve said that your child has a cough, runny nose, and/or sore throat, but doesn&apos;t have any signs of a serious infection.</p><p>Your child most likely has a viral upper respiratory infection. These usually get better by themselves within a few days. Make sure your child gets plenty of rest and fluids. You can give him acetaminophen or ibuprofen for the fever; make sure you read the dosage directions carefully. Talk to your doctor before giving any other medication, and definitely call the doctor if he&apos;s getting worse or doesn&apos;t improve in a couple of days.</p>
