					<h1>Fever in Children</h1>
<p>You&apos;ve said that your child has a fever, but doesn&apos;t have any other symptoms, including: cough, runny nose, sore throat, stomachache, earache, pain with urination, pain elsewhere in his body, rash, swollen glands, red eyes, red lips or tongue, or red and swollen areas of the skin. You&apos;ve also said that your child has had a fever for four days or less.</p><p>Your child is a bit of a puzzle. It could be that your child&apos;s illness is just beginning and so other symptoms haven&apos;t appeared yet. There are also some viruses that can give fever and nothing else.</p><p>To be safe, though, it would be a good idea to give your doctor a call today to go over your child&apos;s symptoms again to be sure there&apos;s nothing we&apos;ve missed. Together, you and your doctor can decide whether and when a visit to the office makes sense.</p>
