					<h1>Fever in Children</h1>
					<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Fevers are very common in children. They are usually a sign that the body is trying to fight an infection.</p><p>The normal temperature of the body is 98.6F, or 37C. Your child&apos;s temperature may vary during the day and may increase a little when he&apos;s bundled up or very active. Generally, doctors say that there is a fever when the temperature is greater than or equal to 100.4F, or 38C.</p><p>Use a digital thermometer to take your child&apos;s temperature; never use a glass mercury thermometer. Most children aged&#xA0; three years and older can hold a thermometer under their tongue. If your child is younger than that, or you&apos;re having difficulty with the oral method, talk to your doctor about the best way to take his temperature.</p><p>Use this guide if your child is over a year old. If he or she is younger than 12 months of age, visit our Fever in Infants guide.</p><p>The guide is designed to help you understand what may be the cause of your child&apos;s fever and the actions you should consider. Remember -- this guide is not meant to take the place of a call to or visit with your doctor. If your child has a chronic medical problem, such as sickle cell anemia, or is being treated for cancer or any other serious disease, you should absolutely call the doctor rather than using this guide.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/fever-in-children-2.html">Click here to begin.</a></p>
