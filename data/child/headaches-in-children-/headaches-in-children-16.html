					<h1>Headaches in Children</h1>
<p>It&apos;s possible that your child is suffering from migraine headaches, which are common in children.</p><p>Make an appointment with your child&apos;s doctor to have your child examined and discuss the headaches. If your doctor agrees with the diagnosis, and if the headaches are frequent or severe enough to be interfering with your child&apos;s daily life, your doctor may wish to prescribe medication to prevent them.</p><p>While you wait for the appointment with your doctor, the following may help your child:</p><p>- Make sure your child eats regularly, gets at least 8-10 hours of sleep a night, and drinks fluids throughout the day, as these can help prevent the headaches</p><p>- If your child gets a headache, give ibuprofen (be sure to follow package dosing instructions carefully) and have him or her rest, preferably in a quiet, darkened room</p>
