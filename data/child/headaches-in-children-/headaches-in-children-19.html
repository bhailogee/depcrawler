					<h1>Headaches in Children</h1>
<p>Good news so far. Based on your answers, a serious medical problem is unlikely.</p><p>To help your child feel better, give acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain. Follow the package dosing directions carefully. If you&apos;re not sure how much to give, call your doctor. Make sure your child is eating and drinking regularly, and getting enough sleep. Watch for any signs of stress.</p><p>Keep track of how often the headaches are happening (keep a written diary) and any associated details -- such as time of day, other symptoms, whether your child had eaten, or what was going on at the time.</p><p>If the headaches recur every day or get worse or don&apos;t go away, call your doctor. If you do need to call, the diary will be very helpful to your doctor.</p>
