					<h1>Jaundice in Newborns</h1>
<p>Many babies have jaundice. After the first few days of life, a baby&apos;s liver generally is better able to get rid of bilirubin. This means that most infants naturally become less jaundiced (the amount of bilirubin in the blood gets lower) on their own over time.</p><p>Having answered &quot;No&quot; to all the risk factor questions means that your baby is likely to be able to handle the jaundice on its own. To be sure, it&apos;s important that your baby see the doctor within a few days after leaving the hospital.</p><p>It is important that you feed your baby frequently. Newborns need to eat eight to ten times a day. Getting dehydrated will make jaundice worse. Be sure to let your doctor know immediately if your baby seems to be eating or peeing less than normal. You should also <b>call the doctor if your baby looks very yellow to you.</b></p>
