					<h1>Jaundice in Newborns</h1>
<p>Jaundice usually is noticed first on the face, in the whites of a baby&apos;s eyes, and then on the rest of the body. The best way to notice the yellow color is in good light, such as daylight or fluorescent light, but it always is more difficult to see jaundice in infants with darker skin color.</p><p><b>Does your newborn have jaundice?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/jaundice-in-newborns-17.html">Yes, my newborn has jaundice.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/jaundice-in-newborns-3.html">No, as far as I know, my newborn does not have jaundice.</a></p>
