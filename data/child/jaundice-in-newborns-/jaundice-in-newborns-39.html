					<h1>Jaundice in Newborns</h1>
<p>Depending on the age of your baby and the level of the bilirubin, as well as the resources available where you live, your baby may need to receive treatment in the hospital or may be able to have this treatment at home. In either case, your baby will have to have the bilirubin level checked again, to make sure that the treatment is working.</p><p>If you will be treating the jaundice at home, it is important that you understand how to work the special lights or blanket that you are given to treat your baby&apos;s jaundice. It also is very important that your baby be seen for follow-up, as decided with your doctor. Often that means returning to the hospital or doctor&apos;s office to check your baby&apos;s weight and bilirubin level. Sometimes this can be done by a visiting nurse in your home.</p><p>It also is important that you feed your baby frequently. Newborns need to eat eight to ten times a day. Getting dehydrated will make jaundice worse. Be sure to let your doctor know immediately if your baby seems to be eating or urinating less than normal.</p>
