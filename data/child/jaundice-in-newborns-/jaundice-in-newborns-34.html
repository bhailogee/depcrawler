					<h1>Jaundice in Newborns</h1>
<p>Many babies have jaundice. After the first few days of life, a baby&apos;s liver generally is better able to get rid of bilirubin. This means that most infants naturally become less jaundiced on their own over time.</p><p>Having answered &quot;No&quot; to all the risk factor questions means that your baby is likely to be able to handle the jaundice on its own. To be sure, the doctor will want to see your baby shortly after birth. <b>Call your doctor&apos;s office today</b> to schedule the appointment if you haven&apos;t already done so.</p><p>It is important that you feed your baby frequently. Newborns need to eat eight to ten times a day. Getting dehydrated will make jaundice worse. Be sure to <b>let your doctor know immediately if your baby seems to be eating or peeing less, or if he looks more yellow.</b></p>
