					<h1>Jaundice in Newborns</h1>
<p>Most babies who have jaundice are going to have problems with high levels of bilirubin and look jaundiced before 72 hours. However, sometimes jaundice is not noticed until after 72 hours.</p><p>Many babies have jaundice. After the first few days of life, a baby&apos;s liver generally is better able to get rid of bilirubin. This means that most infants naturally become less jaundiced (the amount of bilirubin in the blood gets lower) on their own over time.</p><p>Having answered &quot;No&quot; to all the risk factor questions means that your baby is likely to be able to handle the jaundice on his own. To be sure, the doctor may want to see your baby within a few days after leaving the hospital.</p><p>It is important that you feed your baby frequently. Newborns need to eat eight to ten times a day. Getting dehydrated will make jaundice worse. Be sure to let your doctor know immediately if your baby seems to be eating or urinating less, or if he looks yellow.</p>
