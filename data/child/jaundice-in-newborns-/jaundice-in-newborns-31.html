					<h1>Jaundice in Newborns</h1>
<p>Many babies have jaundice. After the first few days of life, a baby&apos;s liver generally is better able to get rid of bilirubin. This means that most infants naturally become less jaundiced (the amount of bilirubin in the blood gets lower) on their own over time.</p><p>Having answered &quot;Yes&quot; to one or more risk factor questions means that your baby is less likely to be able to handle the jaundice on its own. The doctor will want to see your baby; how soon will depend on how many risk factors your baby has. <b>If your baby does not have an appointment, call the doctor today.</b></p><p>It is important that you feed your baby frequently. Newborns need to eat eight to ten times a day. Getting dehydrated will make jaundice worse. Be sure to <b>let your doctor know immediately if your baby seems to be eating or urinating less or looks any more yellow.</b></p>
