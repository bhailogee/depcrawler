					<h1>Vomiting in Infants</h1>
<p>Spitting up after eating is common in babies because the muscle between the stomach and the esophagus (the tube connecting the stomach and the mouth) is not yet fully developed and stomach contents can easily come back up. This condition is called reflux. Discuss this with your doctor at your baby&apos;s next visit.</p><p><b>Call your doctor</b> if the spitting up seems to bother your baby (for example if he cries when he spits up), or if you think your baby is not gaining the right amount of weight, or if your baby starts spitting up much more, or forcefully.</p>
