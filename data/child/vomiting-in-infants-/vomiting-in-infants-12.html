					<h1>Vomiting in Infants</h1>
<p>Your baby has not just started solid foods or tried any new foods recently. That makes it unlikely that a food allergy is causing the vomiting. Keep in mind, though, that an allergy to a certain food can appear even after your child has eaten that food several times.</p><p><b>Has your baby started taking any prescription medication, over-the-counter medications, vitamins or other nutritional supplements? If you are breastfeeding your baby, are you taking any medications or nutritional supplements?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/vomiting-in-infants-16.html">Yes, my baby is on medication, or I am on medication.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/vomiting-in-infants-13.html">No, my baby and I are not taking any medication.</a></p>
