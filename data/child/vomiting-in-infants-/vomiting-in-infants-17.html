					<h1>Vomiting in Infants</h1>
<p>When babies try solid foods for the first few times, they often spit out more than they swallow. Babies also may spit out a new food because the taste is not familiar to them. Sometimes vomiting can be a sign of a food allergy.</p><p><b>Call your doctor</b> if your baby has been vomiting for more than a few days, if the vomiting is getting worse (more forceful, or so frequent that he&apos;s having trouble keeping things down) or green, or if your baby gets new symptoms like fever, diarrhea, rash, irritability, or unusual sleepiness.</p><p>Click on the links to learn more about&#xA0;food allergy and&#xA0;celiac disease.</p>
