					<h1>Unexplained Weight Gain in Children</h1>
<p>It&apos;s very likely that your child&apos;s diet is contributing to his or her weight gain.</p><p>To improve his or her diet, be sure that your child:</p><p>- Gets several servings of fruits and vegetables each day</p><p>- Eats whole grains, such as brown rice and whole-wheat bread and pasta</p><p>- Drinks water instead of juices or sugary drinks</p><p>- Doesn&apos;t have more than 24 ounces of milk a day (and doesn&apos;t sweeten it!)</p><p>- Limits high-fat foods</p><p>- Keeps portion sizes reasonable, and doesn&apos;t have seconds of meat or carbohydrates (seconds of vegetables and fruits is fine!)</p><p>- Has healthy snacks, such as fruit, vegetables, or low-fat yogurt</p><p>- Eats regularly (no skipping meals!)</p><p>Make an appointment with your doctor in the next week or so to have your child weighed, measured, and examined. Together, you, your doctor, and your child can figure out why he or she is gaining weight -- and what to do about it.</p><p>We hope this guide has been helpful to you.</p>
