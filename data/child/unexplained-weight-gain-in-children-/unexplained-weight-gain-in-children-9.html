					<h1>Unexplained Weight Gain in Children</h1>
<p>These are signs that your child&apos;s body may be making too much of the hormone cortisol, a condition called Cushing&apos;s syndrome. Call your doctor for an appointment in the next few days. Along with a careful physical examination, your doctor will want to do some tests to determine if there is indeed too much cortisol being produced. There are various causes of Cushing&apos;s syndrome, which your doctor, and most likely a specialist, would sort out with further tests.</p><p>Acne, redness of the face, stretch marks, weight gain in odd places, or early puberty can have other causes as well. While you should absolutely make the appointment with your doctor, if your child is showing these symptoms (especially if just one or two), we suggest you continue with the decision guide to look at other possible causes of your child&apos;s unexplained weight gain.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/unexplained-weight-gain-in-children-10.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
