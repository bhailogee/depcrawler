					<h1>Asthma Treatment in Kids</h1>
<p>Children with moderate persistent asthma have symptoms more often than is desirable, and should be on stronger daily &quot;control&quot; medications to try to decrease the frequency and severity of symptoms.</p><p>For control (prevention) of symptoms, the following are recommended for older children with moderate persistent asthma:</p><ul><li><p>Preferred treatment --&#xA0;low- to medium-dose inhaled steroids and long-acting inhaled beta-2 agonists</p></li><li><p>Alternative treatment -- medium-dose inhaled steroids&#xA0;or low- to medium-dose inhaled steroids and either leukotriene modifiers or theophylline.</p></li></ul><p>NOTE: As soon as symptoms are under control, your doctor will want to try to decrease the medications to the least amount possible to maintain control.</p><p>All children with asthma may need occasional &quot;rescue&quot; medications to treat asthma &quot;attacks,&quot; occasional periods of asthma symptoms, often triggered by a viral infection (such as the common cold), exposure to an allergen (for example, pets or pollens), or exposure to an irritant (such as cigarette smoke).</p><p>For quick relief of symptoms in older children, use a short-acting inhaled (breathed-in) beta-2 agonist first. If the symptoms are severe, or the child has had severe attacks in the past, a short course of steroids given by mouth or directly into the bloodstream may be recommended.</p><p>Click below for more information on the treatments recommended above.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/asthma-treatment-in-kids-31.html">Theophylline</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/asthma-treatment-in-kids-32.html">Leukotriene modifiers</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/asthma-treatment-in-kids-34.html">Steroids</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/asthma-treatment-in-kids-33.html">Short-acting beta-2 agonists</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/asthma-treatment-in-kids-30.html">Long-acting beta-2 agonists</a></p>
