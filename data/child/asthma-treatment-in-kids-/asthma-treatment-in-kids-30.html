					<h1>Asthma Treatment in Kids</h1>
<p>A beta-2 agonist is a bronchodilator, a type of medicine that opens up the airways by relaxing the muscles around them, making it easier to breathe. Long-lasting ones, such as salmeterol (Serevent), take a while to work, so these should never be used for quick relief. These inhaled medicines are most useful for nighttime symptoms and to prevent exercise-related symptoms and are commonly used with inhaled steroids. They are given by a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) or a dry powder inhaler (DPI). Your doctor may recommend that your child use a spacer (holding chamber) with this medication, so that more of it gets into the lungs.</p>
