					<h1>Unexplained Weight Loss in Children</h1>
<p>Your child&apos;s weight loss could be caused by an eating disorder. Eating disorders are becoming increasingly common. They are seen not just in teenage girls but in younger children -- and in boys. Call your doctor for an appointment in the next few days to discuss whether your child has an eating disorder -- and what you can do about it. With medical and psychological help, most children with eating disorders can recover fully.</p>
