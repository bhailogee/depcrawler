					<h1>Unexplained Weight Loss in Children</h1>
<p>Call your doctor now.</p><p>Illness is one of the most common reasons for weight loss in children, both because the fever burns up extra calories, and because children eat less when they are sick.</p><p>However, any illness that is serious enough to cause weight loss warrants being checked by a doctor. He or she will decide if further tests or treatments are needed.</p>
