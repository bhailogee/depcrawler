<p>Intestinal problems, such as parasites, celiac disease, or inflammatory bowel disease, can cause weight loss in children. Your child doesn&apos;t have any obvious signs of these, but the signs aren&apos;t always obvious, so your doctor may still want to do some tests to look for intestinal problems.</p><p>Along with the weight loss, has your child been drinking and urinating much more than usual?</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/unexplained-weight-loss-in-children-26.html">Yes, much more than usual.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/unexplained-weight-loss-in-children-8.html">No, not much more than usual.</a></p>
