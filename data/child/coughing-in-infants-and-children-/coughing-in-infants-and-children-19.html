					<h1>Coughing in Infants and Children</h1>
<p>Your child&apos;s cough may be caused by second-hand smoke or polluted air. It&apos;s very important that no one smokes near your child. Encourage any smokers in your household to stop. If they can not stop, have them smoke outside and never let them smoke in your car. Do your best to limit your child&apos;s exposure to polluted air, and consider installing an air purifier in your child&apos;s room.</p><p>Being around secondhand smoke and polluted air can increase your child&apos;s risk of asthma and lung infections. If your child&apos;s cough is persistent, or he has a fever, you should call your doctor.</p>
