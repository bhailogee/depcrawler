					<h1>Abdominal Pain in Children</h1>
<p>You have reached the end of this guide that has covered the more common reasons for abdominal pain in children. Based on your responses, no particular cause is suggested. It is still likely that your child&apos;s symptoms are related to one of the conditions we touched on, and your child&apos;s symptoms just didn&apos;t seem to match up. For example, your child may have an early intestinal infection without the usual diarrhea yet. Or, he may have one of the uncommon causes of abdominal pain.</p><p><b>Call your doctor</b> to go over the symptoms again and decide whether and when a visit to the office makes sense.</p><p>If you live in an older home that may contain lead, or your child could have had some other exposure to lead, make sure you <b>tell your doctor</b>, as lead poisoning can cause abdominal pain.</p>
