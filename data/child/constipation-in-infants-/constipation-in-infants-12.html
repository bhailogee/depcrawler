					<h1>Constipation in Infants</h1>
<p>Switching from breastmilk to formula causes some babies to become constipated. Call to discuss this with your doctor. Usually the stools will become soft after a few days on the formula, as your baby gets used to this new food. If it doesn&apos;t, your doctor can suggest some ways to help relieve the constipation.</p><p>Constipation is not caused by the iron that is in formula. You should never switch to a low-iron formula unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so. Iron is important for your baby&apos;s growth and development.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/constipation-in-infants-13.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
