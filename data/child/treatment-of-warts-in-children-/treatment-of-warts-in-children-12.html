					<h1>Treatment of Warts in Children</h1>
<p>This is the one &quot;treatment&quot; option that can safely be tried anywhere on the body. A few studies suggest that warts will go away faster if they are &quot;wished away.&quot; This method, sometimes called &quot;hypnotic suggestion,&quot; has no risks associated with it and may also be helpful in combination with other therapies.</p><p>For a few minutes each day, help your child imagine that the wart is shrinking, perhaps thinking about special cells in their body &quot;fighting off&quot; the wart germs. You may want to sprinkle a &quot;magic potion&quot; on the wart, using something harmless like water.</p><p>Next you can learn about other home treatments, skip to treatments used by doctors or exit the guide.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-warts-in-children-13.html">Click here to learn about salicylic acid.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-warts-in-children-14.html">Click here to learn about duct tape.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-warts-in-children-15.html">Click here to learn about treatments used by doctors.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-warts-in-children-16.html">Click here to exit this guide.</a></p>
