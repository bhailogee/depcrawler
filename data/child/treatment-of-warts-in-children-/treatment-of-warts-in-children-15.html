					<h1>Treatment of Warts in Children</h1>
<p>If the home treatments (&quot;magical thinking,&quot; salicylic acid, and/or duct tape) aren&apos;t helpful, there are treatments your doctor or dermatologist can offer, including:</p><ul><li><p>freezing, using liquid nitrogen. This works by causing a blister to form around the wart; when the dead tissue sloughs off, so does the wart. It may take several treatments to work, and some children find it uncomfortable.</p></li><li><p>Cantharidin is a medication that doctors can paint onto the warts that sometimes helps them go away. Again, repeated treatments may be necessary.</p></li><li><p>Aldara is a prescription cream that increases the body&apos;s immune response to the wart.</p></li><li><p>minor surgery or laser surgery is usually reserved for hard-to-treat warts, as there is a risk of infection or scarring.</p></li></ul><p>Sometimes a dermatologist will inject medication such as bleomycin into a wart, but this too is reserved for special cases.</p><p>If the wart is bleeding frequently or has changed in appearance, you should call your doctor.</p><p>You and your doctor will decide if treatment can be carried out in the office or whether a visit with a dermatologist (a skin specialist) makes sense.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-warts-in-children-16.html">Click here to exit this guide.</a></p>
