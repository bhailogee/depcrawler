					<h1>Treatment of Warts in Children</h1>
<p>Salicylic acid is available without a prescription (over-the-counter) as a paint-on liquid and a sticky patch. This painless medicine is applied every day, and usually must be used for many weeks before the wart goes away. It usually does not cause scarring.</p><p>For best results, first scrape off any dead skin on the top of the wart using a clean nail file, emery board, pumice stone, or scrub brush. Next, have your child take a bath or shower. Lightly pat the area dry with a towel and then apply the medicine; it goes deeper into the skin and works better if it is applied when the skin is still damp. If using liquid, cover the area with a bandage or piece of plastic tape. Repeat every day. The sticky patch usually comes with its own bandage. Most brands say to leave on the patch for 48 hours and then repeat the process.</p><p>If the medicine irritates the surrounding skin, put petroleum jelly (Vaseline) around the wart before applying the medicine.</p><p>Next you can learn about other home treatments, skip to treatments used by doctors or exit the guide.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-warts-in-children-12.html">Click here to learn about &quot;magical thinking.&quot;</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-warts-in-children-14.html">Click here to learn about duct tape.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-warts-in-children-15.html">Click here to learn about treatments used by doctors.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/treatment-of-warts-in-children-16.html">Click here to exit this guide.</a></p>
