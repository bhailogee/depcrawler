<p>It&apos;s great that you are able to breastfeed your baby. Breastmilk generally contains all the calories and nutrients that a baby needs for the first six months of life.</p><p>However, babies who are exclusively breastfed need vitamin D supplements. To prevent rickets and vitamin D deficiency, it is recommended that all breastfed babies take a vitamin D supplement (200 IU per day), starting within the first two months of life. This supplement should be continued until your baby is drinking at least 16 ounces per day of vitamin-D fortified formula (or milk, which can be started after one year of age).</p><p><b>Was your baby born early (premature) or very small (low birth weight)?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nutrition-assessment-for-infants-and-toddlers-88.html">Yes, my baby was born early or very small.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nutrition-assessment-for-infants-and-toddlers-87.html">No, my baby was not born early or very small.</a></p>
