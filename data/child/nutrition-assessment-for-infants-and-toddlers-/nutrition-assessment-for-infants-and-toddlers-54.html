					<h1>Nutrition Assessment for Infants and Toddlers</h1>
<p>During the first six months of life, babies get most of their nutrition from breastmilk or formula. Between six and 12 months of age, babies need to eat other foods in order to meet all of their nutritional needs. By the end of their first year, most babies are eating foods from all the food groups.</p><p><b>Is your baby drinking only breast milk, only formula, or some formula and some breastmilk?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nutrition-assessment-for-infants-and-toddlers-63.html">My baby drinks only breastmilk.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nutrition-assessment-for-infants-and-toddlers-59.html">My baby drinks only formula.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nutrition-assessment-for-infants-and-toddlers-55.html">My baby drinks some formula and some breastmilk.</a></p>
