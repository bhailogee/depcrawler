<p>Your child needs several servings of fruits each day. Try offering a variety of fruits. Keep a bowl of fruit handy for snacks; offer fruits instead of other high-sugar or high-fat snack foods.</p><p>Favorite fruit suggestions for young children include: apples, bananas, nectarines, peaches, pears, oranges, grapefruits, and strawberries. Older children may also enjoy cantaloupe and other melons, mango, kiwi, plums, and dried fruits such as apricots, dates, prunes, and raisins. <b>Remember that whole grapes and cherries should not be given to toddlers because they are a choking hazard.</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nutrition-assessment-for-infants-and-toddlers-15.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
