<p>Babies who are mostly breastfed need vitamin D supplements. To prevent rickets and vitamin D deficiency, it is recommended that all breastfed babies take a vitamin D supplement (200 IU per day), starting within the first two months of life. This supplement should be continued until your baby is drinking at least 16 ounces per day of vitamin-D fortified formula (or milk, which can be started after one year of age).</p><p>Babies who drink low-iron formula may not be getting enough iron to meet their needs. <b>Ask your doctor if your baby should be taking iron supplements.</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nutrition-assessment-for-infants-and-toddlers-58.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
