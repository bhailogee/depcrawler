					<h1>Nutrition Assessment for Infants and Toddlers</h1>
<p>Pediatricians and nutritionists strongly recommend that you breast-feed your baby for at least the first four to six months of life, and continue until 12 months, if at all possible.</p><p>After six months of age, your baby requires other foods to provide more calories, protein, and iron. Fortunately, most babies begin to show interest in other foods and develop the ability to eat them at around six months of age.</p><p>Pediatricians do not recommend starting solid foods prior to six months. Most babies are not ready to handle solid foods before this age. The introduction of solid foods before six months may not provide the proper balance of nutrients and may increase the risk of food allergies.</p>
