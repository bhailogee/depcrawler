<p>It is great that you are still breastfeeding.</p><p>If you are not already doing so, <b>ask your doctor</b> whether your baby needs vitamin D supplements. Babies who are drinking only breastmilk need vitamin D supplements. To prevent rickets and vitamin D deficiency, it is recommended that all breastfed babies take a vitamin D supplement (200 IU per day) starting within the first two months of life. This supplement should be continued until your baby is drinking at least 16 ounces per day of vitamin-D fortified milk.</p><p>Breastfeeding can continue for as long as you and your baby like.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nutrition-assessment-for-infants-and-toddlers-36.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
