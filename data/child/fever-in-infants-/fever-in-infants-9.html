You can give acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever; read the dosage directions carefully. Don&apos;t give any other medications without the advice of your doctor.</p><p>You should also call the doctor if your baby has a high fever (greater than 102 F or 39 C), trouble breathing, rash, very poor appetite, increased fussiness, or if he isn&apos;t improving in a couple of days.</p>
