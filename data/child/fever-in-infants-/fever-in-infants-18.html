					<h1>Fever in Infants</h1>
<p>Your baby has a fever, but doesn&apos;t appear to have any signs or symptoms of the common causes of fever in infants.</p><p>This is a bit of a puzzle. It&apos;s possible that your child&apos;s illness is just beginning, and more symptoms will appear shortly.</p><p>It can be hard, though, to know what&apos;s going on with babies; signs of infection and other problems can be subtle, and they can&apos;t tell us what they are feeling.</p><p><b>Give your doctor a call today</b> to go over your child&apos;s symptoms again and decide whether and when an office visit would make sense.</p>
