					<h1>Fever in Infants</h1>
<p><b>Call your doctor immediately.</b></p><p>While most fevers in infants are not caused by serious infections, doctors are more cautious with very young infants; their defenses are not as strong as older infants.</p><p>All babies less than three months of age with fevers of 100.4 F (38 C) should be seen as close to immediately as possible, and many will need tests of the blood, urine, and spinal fluid.</p>
