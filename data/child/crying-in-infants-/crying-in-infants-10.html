<p>Even though your baby is not drooling any more than usual, it still is possible that he is getting a new tooth (teething). Check your baby&apos;s mouth for swollen gums. Babies may cry if their mouth hurts where a tooth is coming through the gums.</p><p><b>Does your baby begin to cry just before he goes to sleep? Do his arms and legs twitch just before he goes to sleep, too?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/crying-in-infants-11.html">Yes, my baby cries just before he goes to sleep.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/crying-in-infants-12.html">No, my baby does not cry or twitch just before going to sleep.</a></p>
