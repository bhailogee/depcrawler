					<h1>Rash in Newborns</h1>
<p><b>Is the rash purple or does it look like a bruise?</b></p><p>Note: many babies are born with purplish spots on their skin, often over the lower back, or buttocks, called Mongolian spots (discussed further on in this guide). They can look like bruises, but they are actually birthmarks. If your baby has had the spots since birth and you&apos;ve discussed them with your doctor, you should answer &quot;no&quot; to this question. If they&apos;ve appeared since birth, or you&apos;re not sure, or you haven&apos;t talked with your doctor about them, you should answer &quot;yes.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/rash-in-newborns-24.html">Yes, the rash is purple or looks like a bruise.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/rash-in-newborns-5.html">No, the rash is not purple and does not look like a bruise.</a></p>
