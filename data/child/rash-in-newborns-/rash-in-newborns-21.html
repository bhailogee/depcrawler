					<h1>Rash in Newborns</h1>
<p>Diaper rashes in babies are common. They can happen when your baby&apos;s sensitive skin comes in contact with ammonia in urine or acids in stool. Most rashes improve with changing diapers more often, giving the skin a chance to &quot;air out&quot; between diaper changes, and using a diaper cream. If your baby&apos;s rash doesn&apos;t improve after a few days or gets worse (especially if he also has a rash around his mouth or on his hands or feet), <b>consult your doctor</b>. It may be due to a yeast infection or another problem.</p><p>For more information on diaper rash visit our Diaper Rash Decision Guide.</p>
