					<h1>Rash in Newborns</h1>
<p>Many newborn babies get pimples on the face, called neonatal or baby acne, due to hormones passed through the blood from mom at the end of pregnancy. Pimples also may appear on the chest, back and diaper area. Baby acne typically starts between two and five weeks of age. It is a harmless rash that usually goes away without any treatment by four to six months of age. Do not put anything on this rash unless directed to do so by a doctor, as it will not help and may make the acne worse.</p><p><b>Call your doctor</b> if the rash seems to be bothering your baby or is getting worse.</p>
