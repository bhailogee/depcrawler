					<h1>Rash in Newborns</h1>
<p>It is common for a baby&apos;s skin to peel, usually starting when the baby is about 24 to 36 hours old. (The skin may start to peel even earlier in babies who are born well after their due date.) This peeling may continue for up to three weeks. It is not necessary to put any lotion on your baby&apos;s skin. It will not help the peeling go away any faster and might actually be irritating for some babies.</p><p><b>Call your doctor</b> if your baby seems bothered by the peeling, or if the underlying skin looks cracked, red or dry.</p>
