					<h1>Rash in Newborns</h1>
<p>Flat, brown patches, called cafe-au-lait spots, are sometimes seen on a baby&apos;s skin (and also can develop later in life). They can vary in color from light brown in fair-skinned children to darker brown in dark-skinned children, and can vary in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters, even covering an entire arm or leg. They usually do not fade over time and often seem to get bigger as a child&apos;s skin grows.</p><p>Having one or two cafe-au-lait spots is common and usually not cause for concern. In rare cases, having more than five cafe-au-lait spots is associated with neurofibromatosis, a genetic condition that affects mainly the skin and the central nervous system (brain and spinal column). Your doctor will want to follow any cafe-au-lait spots closely and count them at each visit.</p>
