					<h1>Vomiting or Nausea in Children</h1>
<p>You have said that your child has a headache along with nausea and/or vomiting but does not have fever, stiff neck, eye pain, or blurry vision, does not seem confused, and does not wake up with headaches or vomiting. That makes it unlikely that your child has a serious infection or problem with his brain.</p><p>However, having a headache along with nausea and vomiting could mean that your child has a viral infection or a migraine headache. <b>Call your pediatrician to discuss your child&apos;s symptoms.</b></p>
