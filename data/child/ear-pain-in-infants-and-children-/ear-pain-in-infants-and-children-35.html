					<h1>Ear Pain in Infants and Children</h1>
<p>Your child has ear pain and seems to have trouble hearing but does not have any speech problems. His ears could feel like they are blocked if they are filled with wax (cerumen). This wax is normal and eventually will come out -- do not try to remove it with cotton swabs.</p><p><b>Call your doctor</b> so that your child&apos;s ears can be checked for this, and to see if there is any other explanation for his symptoms.</p><p>Click here to learn about wax blockage of the ear canal.</p>
