					<h1>Ear Pain in Infants and Children</h1>
<p>You&apos;ve said that your child has ear pain that isn&apos;t severe but no fever, nothing coming out of his ears, no cold or flu symptoms, no feeling of his ears being clogged, no ringing in his ears, and doesn&apos;t have any trouble with his teeth.</p><p>It&apos;s hard to know what is causing your child&apos;s discomfort.</p><p>Try some acetaminophen or ibuprofen (read the dosage directions carefully). Call your doctor if the pain gets worse or your child develops any of the symptoms mentioned above. You should also call your doctor if the pain isn&apos;t gone in a day or two.</p>
