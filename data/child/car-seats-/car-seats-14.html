					<h1>Car Seats</h1>
<p>Even though your child weighs more than 20 pounds, he or she must still ride rear-facing in the back seat, until after the first birthday. However, most rear-facing infant-only seats are designed for children under 20 pounds. A heavier child will need to ride in a <b>convertible seat</b> approved for use at higher weights.</p><p>Click below for more information on these types of seats.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/car-seats-16.html">Information on convertible seat</a></p>
