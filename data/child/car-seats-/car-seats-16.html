					<h1>Car Seats</h1>
<p><b>Convertible seats.</b> Bigger and heavier than infant-only seats, these seats may be used in the rear-facing position until the baby is at least one year old and weighs at least 20 pounds (or more with most models); then the seats can be used in the front-facing position for toddlers who are at least one year and between 20 and 40 pounds (sometimes more).</p><p>Most <b>rear-facing infant-only seats</b> are designed for children who weigh less than 20 pounds. Some models can handle slightly heavier children (up to 22 pounds, sometimes more).</p><p>Because installation directions as well as weight and height limits can vary from seat to seat, it&#x2019;s important to read all directions carefully.</p>
