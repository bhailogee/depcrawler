					<h1>Car Seats</h1>
<p>If your child is at least 4 feet 9 inches tall and at least eight years old, she is likely to fit properly in a regular car seat belt. Have your child sit in the seat to test the fit (see below) before you tell her she does not have to use the booster seat anymore.</p><p>Use a booster seat until your child fits correctly into your car&apos;s seat belt. Even if your child complains that other children her age are not in booster seats, make her do it anyway. It may save her life.</p><p>Click below for information on regular car seat belts.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/car-seats-8.html">Information on regular car seat belt</a></p>
