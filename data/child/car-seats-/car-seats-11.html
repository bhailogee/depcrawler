					<h1>Car Seats</h1>
<p>Once your child weighs at least 40 pounds and his ears have reached the top of his car seat, he is ready for one of the types of&#xA0;<b>booster seats</b> described below:</p><ul><li><p><b>Belt-positioning booster seats</b> use lap/shoulder belts, which raise your child so the lap and shoulder belts fit properly. This helps protect your child&apos;s upper body and head. Both high-back and backless models are available.</p></li><li><p><b>Shield booster seats</b> are designed to be used with lap belts. However, this type does not provide enough upper-body protection, so only use it when lap/shoulder belts are not available. More importantly, this type of booster seat is not approved for children who don&apos;t weigh as much as 40 pounds because they may be thrown (ejected) from the booster seat if there is a rollover crash.&#xA0; Do not attach belt-positioning devices to a booster seat. Shield boosters should only be used without their shields because such devices may pull the lap belt up onto the child&apos;s stomach, causing severe injuries in a crash. There also are no federal safety standards for such devices, so the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration does not recommend their use.</p></li><li><p><b>Combination seats</b> are seats that can be used first as forward-facing car seats (for children who weigh at least 20 pounds and are at least one year old) and later, as booster seats.</p></li></ul><p>Your child should use a booster seat until the car&apos;s seat belt fits properly, which is usually not until he or she is at least eight years old or over 4 feet 9 inches tall.</p>
