					<h1>Car Seats</h1>
<p>Children who weigh more than 40 pounds should ride in their <b>forward-facing car seat</b> until they outgrow that seat, either reaching the seat&apos;s weight limit or growing tall enough for their ears to reach the top of the seat. Children who outgrow their car seat, but are not yet tall enough to fit into a regular car seat belt (usually around 4 feet 9 inches, or between eight and 12 years of age), should ride in a <b>booster seat</b>.</p><p>Click below for more information on these types of car seats.</p><p>If your car only has lap belts, travel vests may be an option if your child has outgrown his car seat but isn&apos;t big enough yet for a booster seat.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/car-seats-11.html">Information on booster seat</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/car-seats-10.html">Information on forward-facing car seat</a></p>
