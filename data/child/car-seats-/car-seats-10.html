					<h1>Car Seats</h1>
<p><b>Forward-facing seats</b> are designed to be used in the forward-facing position only. These seats are certified for use for children weighing 20 pounds or more; the child also must be at least one year old.</p><p>The harness straps should be at or above your child&apos;s shoulders. Forward-facing seats have several slots into which shoulder straps can be inserted, so choose the slots above and as close as possible to your child&apos;s shoulders. The chest clip should be positioned across the chest at armpit level to keep the harness straps in place.</p><p><b>Combination seats</b> are seats that can be used first as forward-facing car seats (for children who weigh at least 20 pounds and are at least one year old) and later, as booster seats.</p>
