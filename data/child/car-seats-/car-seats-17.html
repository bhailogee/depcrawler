					<h1>Car Seats</h1>
<p><b>Rear-facing infant-only seats</b>, used for newborns and infants who weigh up to 20 to 22 pounds, depending on the model, are always rear-facing and should be used only in the back seat. Infant-only seats typically come with a three- or five-point harness (that is, the straps are usually attached in three or five places).</p><p>A child who weighs 20 pounds before he reaches one year of age still should ride rear-facing, but in a <b>convertible seat</b> approved for use at higher weights.</p>
