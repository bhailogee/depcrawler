					<h1>Sore Throat in Children</h1>
<p>You&apos;ve said that your child has a sore throat but isn&apos;t having trouble breathing or swallowing, doesn&apos;t have a high fever, doesn&apos;t have a runny or stuffy nose, doesn&apos;t breathe through his mouth, and isn&apos;t around someone who smokes.</p><p>Your child may have a mild throat infection, such as from a common cold, or may just be in the beginning stages of an illness. Make sure your child rests and drinks plenty of fluids; you can give acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever or discomfort (read the dosage directions on the package carefully). <b>Call you doctor</b> if the symptoms are worsening or if your child isn&apos;t improving within a few days.</p>
