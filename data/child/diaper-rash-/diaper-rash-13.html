<p>Your child&apos;s diaper rash may be atopic dermatitis or eczema. Sometimes called the &quot;itch that rashes,&quot; this condition is characterized by redness and irritation of the skin. It is more common in children who have allergies, but the exact cause of eczema is unknown.</p><p>Severe atopic dermatitis can affect the skin all over the body, causing obvious redness, dryness, scaliness, irritation, and infection. The diaper area is often less affected than other parts of the body, probably because the diaper keeps the skin moist and prevents children from scratching the rash.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/diaper-rash-14.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
