					<h1>Diaper Rash Cream</h1>
<p>To treat this type of diaper rash, it is best to change your baby&apos;s wet or soiled diaper promptly. Clean the area with plain lukewarm water and a soft cloth. Then apply a thick layer of diaper cream or paste, which acts to block the urine and stool from further contact and irritation of the skin. As long as the skin underneath is clean, you do not have to wipe off the cream at each diaper change. Take off just enough to remove any urine or stool, leaving some to protect the skin, and then add another layer of diaper cream.</p><p>It is also important to allow air to circulate in the diaper area, so let your baby go without a diaper if possible or simply put the diaper on more loosely. This prevents moisture from being trapped in the diaper, which can cause further irritation and worsening of the rash.</p><p>If symptoms do not start to improve after three or four days, or seem to be getting worse, <b>call your doctor</b>.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/diaper-rash-8.html">Click here to learn about another diaper rash.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/diaper-rash-18.html">Click here to exit.</a></p>
