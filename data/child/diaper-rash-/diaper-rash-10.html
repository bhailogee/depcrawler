					<h1>Diaper Rash</h1>
<p>Your child&apos;s diaper rash may be candidiasis, which is caused by a yeast (fungus) infection. In this condition, the skin is typically bright red, especially in the creases, with bright red dots along the edges of the rash. This rash is common in babies, especially after having diarrhea or taking antibiotics. It usually does not improve with the usual treatments for diaper rash (for example, frequent changes and diaper cream).</p><p>You should <b>call your doctor</b>. He or she may prescribe an antifungal cream or recommend an over-the-counter one for your baby.</p><p>It is also important to allow air to circulate in the diaper area, so let your baby go without a diaper if possible or simply put the diaper on more loosely. This prevents moisture from being trapped in the diaper, which can cause further irritation and worsening of a yeast infection.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/diaper-rash-11.html">Click here to learn about another diaper rash.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/diaper-rash-18.html">Click here to exit.</a></p>
