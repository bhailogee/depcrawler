					<h1>Risk of Iron Deficiency in Children</h1>
<p>Many children who drink more than 24 ounces of milk each day have iron deficiency. Your doctor may recommend testing for iron deficiency.</p><p>Cow&apos;s milk is low in iron and in some children, and can cause bleeding from the intestine that further increases the risk of iron deficiency. Children do not need to drink more than 16 to 24 ounces of milk per day.</p><p>Your child should be getting iron in their diet every day. Meat and iron-fortified cereals are the best source, but iron can also be found in dried beans, whole grains, eggs (especially egg yolks), dried fruits, and dark leafy vegetables. Giving meat and dark leafy vegetables can increase the absorption of iron, as can giving foods with vitamin C.</p>
