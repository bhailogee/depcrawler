					<h1>Risk of Iron Deficiency in Children</h1>
<p>To prevent iron deficiency, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends only iron-fortified formula (unless instructed otherwise by a physician). Contrary to popular belief, the amount of iron in iron-fortified formula is too small to cause constipation or other gastrointestinal upset, so using low iron formulas is not necessary.</p><p>After six months of age, your baby needs even more iron, both from iron-fortified formula and from solid foods.</p><p><b>Does your baby eat iron-fortified infant cereal?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/risk-of-iron-deficiency-in-children-37.html">Yes, my baby eats iron-fortified cereal.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/risk-of-iron-deficiency-in-children-36.html">No, my baby is not yet eating iron-fortified cereal.</a></p>
