					<h1>Risk of Iron Deficiency in Children</h1>
<p>Children in this age group are at high risk for iron deficiency, due to changes in diet that often happen around this time. In many communities where lots of children have iron deficiency, doctors test every child for iron deficiency at nine to 12 months of age, then again six months later, regardless of other risk factors.</p><p>Since most iron deficiency is related to dietary habits, let&apos;s look at your child&apos;s diet. Your doctor may recommend testing for iron deficiency if your child has any dietary habits that increase the risk for iron deficiency.</p><p><b>What is your baby drinking?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/risk-of-iron-deficiency-in-children-45.html">My baby is breastfeeding only.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/risk-of-iron-deficiency-in-children-34.html">My baby is drinking some breastmilk and some formula.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/risk-of-iron-deficiency-in-children-23.html">My baby is drinking formula only.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/risk-of-iron-deficiency-in-children-18.html">My baby is drinking cow&apos;s milk, goat&apos;s milk, soy milk, or any other non-formula milk.</a></p>
