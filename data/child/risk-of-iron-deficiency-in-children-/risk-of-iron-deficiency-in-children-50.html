					<h1>Risk of Iron Deficiency in Children</h1>
<p>During the first few months of life, babies need lots of iron. They normally build up extra iron in their bodies before they are born (while they are still in the womb). However, some babies are not able to do this. This is especially true for babies that are born early or have low birth weight.</p><p><b>Was your baby born early (more than one month early or before 36 weeks gestation) or did your baby have low birth weight (less than 2500 grams or 5&#xA0;1/2 pounds)?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/risk-of-iron-deficiency-in-children-60.html">Yes, that describes my baby.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/risk-of-iron-deficiency-in-children-51.html">No, that does not describe my baby.</a></p>
