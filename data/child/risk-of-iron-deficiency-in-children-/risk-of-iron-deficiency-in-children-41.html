					<h1>Risk of Iron Deficiency in Children</h1>
<p>Start giving your baby iron-fortified infant cereal. Two or more servings per day of iron-fortified cereal typically meet an infant&apos;s requirement for iron.</p><p>After six months, meat can be another source of iron in your baby&apos;s diet. You can give commercial baby foods containing meat, or very small pieces of lean meat, poultry, or fish (supervise him closely as he eats table foods to prevent choking).</p><p>Foods that are high in vitamin C will help iron get absorbed from the intestine. Your baby should be working toward getting five servings of fruits and vegetables each day.</p>
