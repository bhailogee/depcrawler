					<h1>Risk of Iron Deficiency in Children</h1>
<p>Adolescent females may develop iron deficiency from blood lost during menstruation (periods). In addition, they often eat little meat or other iron-rich foods. Athletic adolescent females seem to be at even higher risk, for reasons that are not well understood. Your doctor may recommend testing for iron deficiency.</p><p>Be sure to encourage foods that are rich in iron, such as fortified cereals, lean meat, fish, poultry, grains, dried peas and beans, dark green vegetables, raisins and eggs. In addition, <b>talk to your doctor</b> about whether a daily multivitamin with iron would be a good idea.</p>
