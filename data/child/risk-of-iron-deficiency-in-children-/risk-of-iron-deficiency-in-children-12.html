					<h1>Risk of Iron Deficiency in Children</h1>
<p>Your child does not appear to be at increased risk for iron deficiency at this time.</p><p>Your child should be getting iron in their diet every day. Meat and iron-fortified cereals are the best source, but iron can also be found in dried beans, whole grains, eggs (especially egg yolks), dried fruits, and dark leafy vegetables. Giving meat and dark leafy vegetables can increase the absorption of iron, as can giving foods with vitamin C.</p>
