					<h1>Risk of Iron Deficiency in Children</h1>
<p>Babies should drink breastmilk or iron-fortified formula during the first year. Drinking cow&apos;s milk or other types of milk before the first birthday increases the risk of iron deficiency because they are low in iron. In addition, cow&apos;s milk can cause irritation of the intestine that can lead to bleeding, which also increases the risk of iron deficiency.</p><p><b>Is your baby eating iron-fortified cereal?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/risk-of-iron-deficiency-in-children-20.html">Yes, my baby eats iron-fortified cereal.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/risk-of-iron-deficiency-in-children-19.html">No, my baby is not yet eating iron-fortified cereal.</a></p>
