					<h1>Risk of Iron Deficiency in Children</h1>
<p>Adolescent males are at increased risk for developing iron deficiency during their growth spurt, when there may not be enough iron in their body to meet the demand. However, adolescent males tend to eat enough red meat and other iron-rich foods to catch up quickly. Your doctor will assess your son&apos;s risk for iron deficiency and test for it if appropriate.</p><p>Be sure to encourage foods that are rich in iron, such as fortified cereals, lean meat, fish, poultry, grains, dried peas and beans, dark green vegetables, raisins and eggs.</p>
