					<h1>Constipation in Children</h1>
<p>Your child is constipated, but not vomiting. When your child tries to pass a hard stool, he may have pain where the stool comes out. However, pain in his abdomen (belly) can be a sign of something more serious.</p><p><b>Is your child having abdominal pain?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/constipation-in-children-20.html">Yes, my child is having abdominal pain.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/constipation-in-children-7.html">No, my child is not having abdominal pain.</a></p>
