					<h1>Shortness of Breath in Infants and Children</h1>
<p>Your child may be coughing due to a nervous habit or tic. (In medical terms, this is called a psychogenic cough.) Try to figure out what might be causing stress in your child&apos;s life, either at home or school. Talk this over with your spouse or family members. Speak with your child&apos;s teachers and ask whether there are any problems at school.</p><p>Call your pediatrician to let him or her know what&apos;s going on. Your pediatrician may suggest counseling for your child if his cough is caused by stress or anxiety.</p>
