					<h1>Shortness of Breath in Infants and Children</h1>
<p>Your child may feel short of breath because he feels anxious or has panic attacks. Try to figure out what might be causing stress in your child&apos;s life, either at home or school. Talk this over with your spouse or family members. Speak with your child&apos;s teachers and ask whether there are any problems at school.</p><p>Call your pediatrician if your child&apos;s these symptoms last for more than a few hours, are happening often, or seem to be getting worse. Your pediatrician may suggest counseling for your child if his shortness of breath is caused by stress or anxiety.</p>
