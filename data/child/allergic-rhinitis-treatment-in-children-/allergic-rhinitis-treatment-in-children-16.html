<p>Prescription medications available for treating allergies in children between the age of six months and two years:</p><p><b>Antihistamines</b> reduce swelling, redness and irritation of the nose and other parts of the body (such as eyes and throat) by blocking the effects of any histamine released by mast cells. For small children, this type of medication is available by prescription in liquid form as cetirizine (Zyrtec, six months and older). non-prescription antihistamines also are available.</p><p><b>Montelukast</b> (Singulair) belongs to a newer class of medicines called leukotriene inhibitors that help prevent allergy (and asthma) symptoms by blocking the effect of leukotriene, a chemical released in the body when someone is exposed to their allergy triggers. It is available, as granules that mix with food or chewable tablets.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/allergic-rhinitis-treatment-in-children-18.html">When should I call the doctor?</a></p>
