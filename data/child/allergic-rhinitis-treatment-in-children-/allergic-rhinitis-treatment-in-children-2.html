					<h1>Allergic Rhinitis Treatment in Children</h1>
<p>If your child has been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, you want to identify what triggers the symptoms. Different people have different triggers and some people have more than one. Some triggers will be obvious, others may be hard to discover and in many cases, you won&apos;t find the main trigger.</p><p>The timing of symptoms (when they happen) gives us a clue to what could be causing them.</p><p>Having symptoms during one season or specific months of the year is called <b>seasonal allergic rhinitis</b>. This type of allergy is uncommon before the age of three years.</p><p>Having symptoms all or most of the time, regardless of the season, is called <b>perennial allergic rhinitis</b>. This can be seen in children of any age.</p><p><b>Does your child have allergy symptoms all the time or only during particular months of the year?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/allergic-rhinitis-treatment-in-children-5.html">My child only has symptoms during particular months.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/allergic-rhinitis-treatment-in-children-3.html">My child has symptoms all the time.</a></p>
