This type of rash may due to a condition called seborrhea (or seborrheic dermatitis), where the skin gets irritated or inflamed because the oil glands are making too much oil (sebum). When limited to the scalp, this rash is called <b>cradle cap.</b></p><p><b>Do you see clear fluid-filled blisters on your child&apos;s skin? Are they clustered together in one spot? Does the rash cause your child pain, especially when it is touched?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/rash-in-children-11.html">Yes, my child has painful, clear fluid-filled blisters.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/rash-in-children-12.html">No, my child does not have painful, clear fluid-filled blisters.</a></p>
