					<h1>Rash in Children</h1>
<p>If your child has a rash that appeared a day or two after getting over a fever, he probably has <b>roseola</b>, a mild illness caused by a virus. The rash typically consists of flat, red spots. The spots turn white if your press on them and may also have a &quot;halo&quot; around them. If your child has roseola, he may also have swollen glands, crankiness, and some diarrhea.</p>
