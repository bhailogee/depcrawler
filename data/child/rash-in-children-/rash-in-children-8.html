					<h1>Rash in Children</h1>
<p>Your child does not have an itchy red rash. An itchy red rash may be caused by a skin irritation, allergy, or infection. For example, eczema, which is also called &quot;atopic dermatitis,&quot; is an itchy red rash that stays for a long period of time and keeps coming back (chronic). Other rashes can start after coming in contact with something irritating to the skin, such as poison ivy or harsh detergent.</p><p>Click on these links to learn about conditions that may cause red, itchy rashes: scabies and contact dermatitis.</p><p><b>Does your child&apos;s rash look like red or salmon-colored patches with greasy, yellow scale or crust?
