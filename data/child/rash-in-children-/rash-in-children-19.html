					<h1>Rash in Children</h1>
<p>Diaper rash is very common in babies and young children. They have sensitive skin, and it can easily become irritated from the acids found in stool or the ammonia found in urine. Treat your child&apos;s diaper rash by changing him more often, letting him go without a diaper for short periods of time between diaper changes to give the skin a chance to &quot;air out,&quot; and applying a diaper cream when you change him.</p><p><b>Call your doctor</b> if the diaper rash doesn&apos;t get better after a few days or worsens. Your child may have a yeast infection or other condition that needs treatment.</p><p>Please visit our guide on Diaper Rash.</p>
