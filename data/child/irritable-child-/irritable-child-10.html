					<h1>Irritable Child</h1>
<p>You do not think your child has been around anyone recently who is ill. That&apos;s good, although keep in mind that some illnesses are contagious before someone shows any symptoms. So, keep looking for symptoms of illness in your child.</p><p>Sometimes children are cranky because something is bothering them inside (emotionally). Children can be cranky because something stressful has happened in their lives, such as moving to a new house, one parent being away from home, or a death in the family. They may be worried about something coming up, such as having a test in school, a game or a recital, or going on a trip.</p><p><b>Is it possible that your child is reacting to stress?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/irritable-child-14.html">Yes, there are some reasons that my child may be feeling stress.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/irritable-child-11.html">No, there doesn&apos;t appear to be any unusual stress in my child&apos;s life.</a></p>
