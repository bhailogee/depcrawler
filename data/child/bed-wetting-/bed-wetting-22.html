					<h1>Bed-Wetting</h1>
<p>You&apos;ve said that your child has had nighttime accidents since he was toilet trained, is less than six years old, and doesn&apos;t have any signs of a medical problem.</p><p>Most likely, your child&apos;s bed-wetting is entirely normal and should go away by itself. Make sure you have a plastic cover on your child&apos;s mattress. Try not to scold your child for accidents. He most likely can&apos;t control them! Instead, be very positive with him whenever he has a dry night. To help him stay dry, limit fluid intake before bedtime.</p><p><b>Call your doctor</b> if you have any concerns about your child, or if he is continuing to wet the bed after age six.</p>
