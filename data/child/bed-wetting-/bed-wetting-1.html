					<h1>Bed-Wetting Solutions</h1>
					<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Your child may wet the bed -- or accidentally pass urine -- at night while he is sleeping. This is called nocturnal enuresis. It&apos;s not at all unusual for a child to wet the bed at night until he is five or six years old. Once a child has reached school age, however, he should not be having frequent trouble controlling his bladder or bowel movements. If he is, it may be due to a physical or psychological problem, and you may want to discuss this with your pediatrician.</p><p>This decision support guide will help you to determine whether your child&apos;s bed-wetting is normal, and to know when to contact your pediatrician for medical care. Please note, this guide is not meant to take the place of a visit to your pediatrician&apos;s office.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/bed-wetting-2.html">Click here to begin.</a></p>
