					<h1>Bed-Wetting Alarm</h1>
<p>You&apos;ve said that your child has had nighttime accidents since toilet training and is more than six years old. You&apos;ve also said that your child doesn&apos;t show any signs of a medical reason for his bed-wetting.</p><p><b>Give your doctor a call to discuss.</b> While bed-wetting regularly past the age of six can certainly happen, especially if the mother or father had the same problem, it can be embarrassing and emotionally difficult for the child.</p><p>Talk with your doctor about the available treatments, such as enuresis alarms and medications. Together, you and your doctor can decide what makes sense for your child.</p>
