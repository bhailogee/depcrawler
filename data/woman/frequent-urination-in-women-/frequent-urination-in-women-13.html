					<h1>Frequent Urination in Women</h1>
<p>It&apos;s less likely that you have a urinary tract infection.</p><p>Some older women and women who have gone through childbirth can develop a weakness in the muscles of the pelvic floor. This can lead to two problems that may cause a feeling of having to urinate often.</p><p>One condition is uterine prolapse, when the uterus bulges down into the vaginal canal. This bulging will put pressure on the bladder and give you the sensation of having to urinate even when the bladder is nearly empty.</p><p>The second condition is a cystocele, when the wall between the bladder and the vagina weakens and the bladder presses into the vaginal canal. This causes the same symptoms of having to urinate many times throughout the day but only a little each time.</p><p>If you think you have either of these conditions, you should talk with your doctor about it. There are treatments such as pessaries that may be able to help you. Surgical treatment can also be helpful for some women.</p>
