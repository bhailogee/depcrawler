During the same period, measure how much urine you put out.</p><p>Because our bodies lose water through sweat and breathing, most adults drink about 27 ounces more than they make in urine each day. (One quart equals 32 ounces.)</p><p>If you are actually putting out higher volumes of urine compared to the amount you are drinking, <b>call your doctor&apos;s office for advice and to arrange an appointment.</b></p><p>Here are some causes of persistent higher urine output:</p><p>- High blood sugar related to diabetes mellitus</p><p>- A high calcium level in the blood (called hypercalcemia)</p><p>- Deficiency of a hormone the kidneys need to hold on to water (called diabetes insipidus)</p><p>- Kidney disease that damages the ability of the kidneys to maintain proper water balance</p><p>- An insatiable desire to drink water even though you may not be thirsty</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/frequent-urination-in-women-8.html">Click here to finish.</a></p>
