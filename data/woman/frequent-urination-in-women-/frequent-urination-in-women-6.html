					<h1>Frequent Urination in Women</h1>
<p>Start to decrease the amount you take in. You should quickly notice less urinary frequency. If you don&apos;t see any change, <b>make an appointment with your doctor.</b></p><p>Causes of persistent high output of urine that doesn&apos;t improve when fluid intake decreases include:</p><p>- High blood sugar related to diabetes mellitus</p><p>- A high calcium level in the blood (called hypercalcemia)</p><p>- Deficiency of a hormone the kidneys need to hold on to water (called diabetes insipidus)</p><p>- Kidney disease that damages the ability of the kidneys to maintain proper water balance</p><p>- An insatiable desire to drink water even though you may not be thirsty</p><p>Also, one of the medications you are taking may be causing the frequent urination. Diuretics are prescribed to increase urine output. Many medications cause dry mouth, leading to more water intake than you think.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/frequent-urination-in-women-8.html">Click here to finish.</a></p>
