					<h1>Bleeding After Menopause</h1>
<p><b>Menopause is time of life when you haven&apos;t had menstrual bleeding for at least a year after your last period. It&apos;s sometimes hard to know which period was or will be the last menstrual period, so it may be helpful to keep a record of the dates of your periods. Periods around and just before menopause can be light or heavy, regular or irregular. The variation is a response to the normal ups and downs of female hormone levels.</b></p><p><b>Do you know you are or think you could be menopausal?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/bleeding-after-menopause-5.html">Yes, I am menopausal.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/bleeding-after-menopause-3.html">No, I don&apos;t think that I am menopausal.</a></p>
