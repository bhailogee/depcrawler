					<h1>Painful Menstrual Cramps</h1>
<p>If your menstrual cramps have developed recently this may indicate a new medical problem or a change in your hormones. For example, painful cramps that have had their start within the past six weeks may be caused by infection or pregnancy. Cramps that started more than six weeks ago are less likely to be from one of these problems.</p><p><b>Did your cramps begin within the last six weeks?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/painful-menstrual-cramps-4.html">Yes, my cramps started less than six weeks ago.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/painful-menstrual-cramps-3.html">No, my cramps started more than six weeks ago.</a></p>
