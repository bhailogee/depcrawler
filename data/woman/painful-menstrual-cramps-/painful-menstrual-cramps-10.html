A diagnosis of fibroids is something that your doctor may consider if your symptoms are new for you, persistent, and accompanied by a change in the length of your period or the heaviness of your menstrual flow, particularly if you are older than 30.</p><p>About 30 percent of women eventually get fibroids. Some women are more likely top get fibroids, including black women, women who have never been pregnant and women who have a mother or sister with fibroids. <b>Contact your health care provider</b> to discuss your symptoms or arrange to be seen by your gynecologist. If you have a fibroid, your diagnosis can usually be made by a pelvic ultrasound.
