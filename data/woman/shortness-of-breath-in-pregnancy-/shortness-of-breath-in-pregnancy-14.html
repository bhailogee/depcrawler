					<h1>Shortness of Breath In Pregnancy</h1>
<p>Shortness of breath that comes and goes, whether you are resting or active, suggests certain possibilities, such as an anxiety or panic disorder or a blood clot that travels to the lung (called pulmonary embolism). Anxiety is much more common than a pulmonary embolism. But this can be a dangerous condition and pregnant women do have a higher than average risk of this problem.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Pulmonary embolism is usually accompanied by other symptoms than the ones present with plain shortness of breath. These other symptoms include:</p><p>- chest pain that hurts more with deep breaths</p><p>- a swollen and/or painful leg</p><p>- new lightheadedness.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><b>Do you have any of these symptoms in addition to shortness of breath?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/shortness-of-breath-in-pregnancy-23.html">Yes, I do.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/shortness-of-breath-in-pregnancy-15.html">No, I don&apos;t.</a></p>
