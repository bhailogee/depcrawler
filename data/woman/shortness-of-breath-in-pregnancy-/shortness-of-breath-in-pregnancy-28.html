<p>That&apos;s great. That means it is less likely that you have a heart problem.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Many women become mildly anemic during pregnancy. Anemia means too few red blood cells in circulation. Mild anemia related to low iron stores, which is common during pregnancy, by itself usually does not cause shortness of breath with exertion. However, a very low red blood cell count could do this. Unusually pale skin (for you) is one clue you might be very anemic.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><b>Do you think you may be very anemic?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/shortness-of-breath-in-pregnancy-46.html">Yes, I think I might.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/shortness-of-breath-in-pregnancy-45.html">No, I don&apos;t think so.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/shortness-of-breath-in-pregnancy-44.html">I&apos;m not sure</a></p>
