					<h1>Shortness of Breath In Pregnancy</h1>
<p>Recent onset shortness of breath with wheezing is probably a condition called reactive airway disease. This means the bronchial tubes are irritated. In response, they produce more mucus and squeeze shut, making it difficult for air to pass through.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>One common cause of reactive airway disease is an upper respiratory infection, like a chest cold. Usually, the wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath go away once the cold fades away. Sometimes, though, wheezing and other signs of reactive airway disease persist for several weeks to a few months after the cold resolves. New wheezing can also be the start of asthma, perhaps triggered by an allergy to something inside the home or office or to outdoor pollen.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Some people wheeze only when they exercise. This is called exercise-induced asthma.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><b>Contact your doctor, nurse, or midwife. </b>Your clinician may prescribe an inhaler to open your bronchial tubes, possibly with a second inhaler to decrease the inflammation inside the airways.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>There may be other reasons for your shortness of breath.
