					<h1>Shortness of Breath In Pregnancy</h1>
<p>Wheezing is another clue that helps determine why you may be short of breath. A wheeze is a whistling sound you can hear when you breathe out.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Wheezing indicates that your bronchial tubes (the tubes that carry air from the nose and mouth into the smaller tubes that supply the lungs) may be inflamed, causing them to narrow and produce excess mucus. When this happens, air can&apos;t move easily through the bronchial tubes, which often causes a wheezing sound.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><b>Do you have wheezing?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/shortness-of-breath-in-pregnancy-12.html">Yes, I can hear myself wheeze.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/shortness-of-breath-in-pregnancy-11.html">No, I don&apos;t hear any wheezing.</a></p>
