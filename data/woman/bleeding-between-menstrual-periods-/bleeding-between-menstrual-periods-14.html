					<h1>Bleeding Between Menstrual Periods</h1>
<p>Your method of birth control is very reliable for preventing pregnancy, but pregnancy can occur in rare cases. If this is your first episode of bleeding between your periods, and if you have been recently sexually active, you need to test for pregnancy. You can use a home pregnancy test to know this information.</p><p>Bleeding early in pregnancy can be a sign of a miscarriage or an ectopic (tubal) pregnancy. Bleeding during pregnancy requires prompt medical attention, although it does not always come from a serious problem. Pregnancy at your age also requires close medical attention.</p><p><b>Contact your doctor or other health care professional immediately if your pregnancy test is positive. If you are pregnant, you should stop taking your birth control medication until you receive your doctor&apos;s advice. You may have a complication of pregnancy that could be dangerous to you if you don&apos;t seek prompt medical care.</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/bleeding-between-menstrual-periods-15.html">What if I am not pregnant?</a></p>
