					<h1>Bleeding Between Menstrual Periods</h1>
<p>Before you consider whether your IUD could be the cause of your bleeding, you need to consider pregnancy. The IUD is a very reliable form of birth control. However, if this is your first heavy bleeding episode with an IUD in place and if you have been recently sexually active, you need to test for pregnancy. You can use a home pregnancy test to know this information.</p><p>In the rare event that a pregnancy does occur with an IUD in place, it is more likely than usual for the pregnancy to locate itself inside one of the fallopian tubes. If it occurs, a tubal pregnancy (ectopic pregnancy) is a life-threatening problem. A tubal pregnancy can cause bleeding that is not timed with the usual period cycle.</p><p><b>If this is your first episode of bleeding between periods, check a pregnancy test today and immediately contact your doctor for an urgent appointment if you are pregnant</b>.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/bleeding-between-menstrual-periods-13.html">What if I am not pregnant?</a></p>
