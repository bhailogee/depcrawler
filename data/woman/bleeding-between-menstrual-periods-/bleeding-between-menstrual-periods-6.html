Bleeding during pregnancy requires prompt medical attention, although it does not always come from a serious problem.</p><p><b>Contact your doctor or other health care professional immediately if your pregnancy test is positive. You may have a complication of pregnancy that could be dangerous to you if you don&apos;t seek prompt medical care.</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/bleeding-between-menstrual-periods-16.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
