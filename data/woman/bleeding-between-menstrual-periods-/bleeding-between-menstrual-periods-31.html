					<h1>Bleeding Between Menstrual Periods</h1>
<p>Bleeding changes are commonly the first symptom of menopause. However, since you are not having other common menopause symptoms, you should schedule a medical evaluation with your doctor so other explanations can be considered.</p><p>You will benefit from having a pap smear, if you have not recently had this test. Your doctor will also consider checking a blood test to check for a thyroid problem, or using an ultrasound to check for a new change on the cervix or in the uterus such as a fibroid tumor, a polyp, or cancer. A common cause of bleeding between periods for a woman your age is endometrial hyperplasia (excessive growth of the menstrual lining).</p>
