					<h1>Bleeding Between Menstrual Periods</h1>
<p>If you have vaginal discharge or pain along with your bleeding between periods, this could suggest an infection in the uterus.</p><p>If an infection is present, you may have noticed milky, yellow, or brown mucus (vaginal &quot;discharge&quot;) that has mixed with the blood you have seen. Sometimes vaginal discharge from an infection has an odor that is more obvious or more objectionable than the smell of blood. An infection can also cause pain in your pelvic area.</p><p><b>Have you noticed any pelvic pain or discharge with the bleeding, with or without an unpleasant odor?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/bleeding-between-menstrual-periods-24.html">Yes, I&apos;ve noticed pain or a discharge with my bleeding.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/bleeding-between-menstrual-periods-17.html">No, I have not had pain or discharge.</a></p>
