					<h1>Bleeding Between Menstrual Periods</h1>
<p>It is likely that your bleeding changes are caused by the beginning of menopause. If you are caught up on having your pap smears (at least every three years) and if your symptoms have not been present for more than a few months, you probably don&apos;t need to see your doctor urgently.</p><p>You should visit with your doctor if your bleeding between periods continues for longer than a few months. In this case, your doctor will need to check for other problems that could explain your bleeding, such as a thyroid problem, a benign growth in the uterus such as a fibroid tumor or a polyp, or cancer of the uterus or cervix. A common cause of bleeding between periods for a woman your age is endometrial hyperplasia (excessive growth of the menstrual lining).</p>
