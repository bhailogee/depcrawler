					<h1>Bleeding Between Menstrual Periods</h1>
<p>An infection is a possible explanation for your symptoms, even though you don&apos;t have a fever. Pain, vaginal discharge, and bleeding between periods can be from an infection of your cervix, vagina or uterus. The most serious infection that can cause these symptoms is a uterus infection, called endometriosis or &quot;pelvic inflammatory disease.&quot;</p><p>It is also possible that your symptoms are coming from an ovarian cyst, a fibroid tumor (a benign growth) in the uterus, a cervical polyp, or other abnormal growth of the cervix, vagina, or uterus, or a menstrual pain problem named endometriosis.</p><p>Due to your pain or discharge, your health care provider must examine you and decide if infection is likely to be the cause of your symptoms. It&apos;s good that you don&apos;t have a fever, but infection remains a likely possibility so you should not delay seeking a doctor&apos;s evaluation.</p><p><b>Contact a health professional now to arrange urgent evaluation.</b></p>
