<p>That makes &quot;traction alopecia&quot; (hair loss due to tension or pulling on the hair) less likely; certain hairstyles are associated with this type of hair loss.</p><p>Patchy hair loss that is not associated with pulling or braiding of the hair could be due to a condition called alopecia areata. This is a poorly understood autoimmune reaction that damages the hair follicles in the scalp. It may be more common in people with other autoimmune and allergic conditions, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, vitiligo, and thyroid disease.</p><p>Alopecia areata can be quite alarming, since it can produce a &quot;moth eaten&quot; appearance to the scalp. However, in most cases, hair will grow back in six to 12 months. Certain treatments (such as steroid injections) can help to speed the healing process.</p><p><b>Call your doctor&apos;s office to arrange an evaluation.</b></p>
