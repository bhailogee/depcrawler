					<h1>Hair Loss in Women</h1>
<p>Most women with this type of hair loss have hereditary pattern baldness. This is also called female-pattern baldness or androgenetic alopecia.</p><p>As the name suggests, hereditary pattern baldness is an inherited condition (and not just from your mother&apos;s family, as is commonly believed). Up to a third of women will experience this type of hair loss at some point in their lives. The first changes of hereditary-pattern baldness can be seen when women are in their 30s or even in their 20s. However, most women notice this type of hair loss after the start of menopause.</p><p>In some cases, hereditary pattern baldness may be due to a hormone imbalance. If this type of hair loss appears before menopause, or if no one else in the family has experienced the same type of hair loss, <b>call your doctor&apos;s office to arrange an evaluation.</b></p><p>Hereditary pattern baldness in women may respond to certain types of hormonal treatment. In addition, non-prescription medicated lotions that contain minoxidil can help to prevent or even reverse this type of hair loss.</p>
