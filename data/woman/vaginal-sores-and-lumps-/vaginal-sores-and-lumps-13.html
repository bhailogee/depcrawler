					<h1>Vaginal Sores and Lumps</h1>
<p>A blister or pimple (or collection of these) containing cloudy fluid (pus) may be from an infection of a hair follicle. A collection of several infected hairs is named folliculitis, which is a form of staph or strep infection. One large pimple that is an infected hair follicle is called a&#xA0;furuncle (boil).&#xA0;A furuncle in the genital area may be from a type of&#xA0;acne &#xA0;named hidradenitis suppurativa. Your doctor may need to treat you with antibiotics if you have one of these infections.</p><p>Pimples at the edge of a red rash may be caused by a yeast infection. The yeast infection that is most common in the vaginal area is &quot;candidiasis.&quot;</p><p>Blisters with clear fluid or skin ulcers may be caused by contact dermatitis (sometimes from cosmetic products), but genital herpes is a much more common explanation. Even though you do not think you are at high risk for having a sexually passed infection, you should see your doctor for an evaluation if you have blisters or skin ulcers in the vaginal area.</p><p>Very rarely, an ulcer on the skin near the vagina can be caused by cancer.</p>
