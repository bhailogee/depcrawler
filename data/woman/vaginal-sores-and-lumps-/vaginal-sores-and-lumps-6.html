<p>The most common cause of a skin lump in the genital area&#xA0;is a skin tag, genital warts, or a boil.</p><p>Skin tags are painless, skin-colored or pink growths. Warts are also painless, skin-colored or pink growths, but usually there is more than one wart at a time and each wart is usually quite small (less than half the size of a pencil eraser.) Genital warts are caused by infection with human papillomavirus, an infection that is spread through sexual contact.</p><p>If you think you may have had a sexual exposure that could put you at risk for a sexually passed infection, you should also have your doctor inspect the area of concern to see if it might be caused by an infection with syphilis. Usually, syphilis causes a skin ulcer but it can cause lumpy skin as well.</p><p>One large pimple may be an infected hair follicle is called a&#xA0;furuncle (boil).&#xA0;A furuncle in the genital area may be from a type of&#xA0;acne named hidradenitis suppurativa. Your doctor may need to treat you with antibiotics if you have an infection.</p><p>Cancer in the genital area is rare, but it does occur.</p><p><b>Your doctor will want to examine your lump or bump so that he or she can make sure this is not a cancer.</b></p>
