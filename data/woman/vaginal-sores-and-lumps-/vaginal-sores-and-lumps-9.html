					<h1>Vaginal Sores and Lumps</h1>
<p>The two most common things that would cause a change in the surface tissue at the entrance to the vagina are skin tags or genital warts.</p><p>Skin tags are painless, skin-colored or pink growths. They don&apos;t require treatment.</p><p>Warts are also painless, skin-colored or pink growths, but usually there is more than one wart at a time and each wart is usually quite small (less than half the size of a pencil eraser.) Genital warts are caused by infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), an infection that is spread through sexual contact. Warts can occur on the outside or the inside of the vagina, and they can also appear around the anus.</p><p>HPV is very contagious and is transmitted by skin to skin contact. Condoms may decrease the risk of transmission but HPV can still be spread when condoms are used. You should avoid sexual contact with your partner if you have active warts. In most cases, the body will eventually clear the virus completely, but this may take years.</p><p>Certain types of HPV can cause cervical cancer. However, the types of HPV that cause cervical cancer are usually not the same types as those that cause genital warts. Regular pap smears should be done in all women to screen for cervical cancer since the various types of HPV are so common.</p><p>Cancer is rare in this area of the body, but it does occur. Your doctor will want to examine your lump so that he or she can make sure this it is not a cancer.</p><p><b>Your doctor will want to examine your lump so that he or she can make sure this is not a cancer.</b></p>
