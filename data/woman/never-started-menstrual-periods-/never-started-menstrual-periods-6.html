					<h1>Never Started Menstrual Periods</h1>
<p>It&apos;s good that you don&apos;t have painful cramps. It is likely that you will start menstruating within the next year or two.</p><p>Most teenage girls start their period before their 16th birthday. But for some it may not come until later. If you are otherwise feeling fine, most likely your body needs a little more time to grow and develop. In general, doctors usually wait until a young woman has reached 17 years of age before beginning any type of medical evaluation.</p><p>However, if you have any concerns, <b>speak with your parents or guardian or call your doctor</b> for advice.</p>
