<p>Hormone-based birth control and IUDs (intrauterine devices) are very effective at preventing pregnancy. Hormone-based birth control includes birth control pills (oral contraceptives), a patch, a vaginal ring (NuvaRing), and Depo-Provera shots.</p><p>Even when used properly, these methods of birth control have a small rate of failure. Bleeding related to pregnancy always needs to be considered.</p><p><b>What type of birth control are you using?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/heavy-menstrual-periods-25.html">I have an IUD (intrauterine device).</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/heavy-menstrual-periods-22.html">I use one of the hormone-based types.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/heavy-menstrual-periods-15.html">I use another form of birth control.</a></p>
