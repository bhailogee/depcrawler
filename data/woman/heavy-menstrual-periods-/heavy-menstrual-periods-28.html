					<h1>Heavy Menstrual Periods</h1>
<p>Thyroid disease is not too likely since you are not having many typical symptoms. Sometimes, a change in menstrual bleeding is the first symptom of thyroid disease. Although you don&apos;t have other symptoms typical of thyroid disease, your doctor may still suggest a blood test to see if your thyroid function is normal.</p><p>Unusually heavy periods can also be a sign that you have a medical problem that prevents your blood from clotting normally. The general name for a clotting problem is &quot;coagulopathy.&quot; If you have a clotting problem, your periods may not be the only heavy bleeding that you have experienced. Some people who have inadequate blood clotting also notice frequent nosebleeds or unusually heavy bleeding from the gums during tooth brushing. Your doctor should review your medicines with you (some medicines &quot;thin&quot; the blood) and your doctor may consider testing to make sure that your blood clotting is normal.</p><p>Heavy periods can also come from a lump or irregularity in the uterus. Examples would be a fibroid (benign growth in the uterus), a uterine polyp, or a cervical polyp. An ultrasound can be used to check for these abnormal growths. Heavy periods can also occur in women who have one cause of recurring pain with their menses, &quot;endometriosis.&quot;</p><p><b>Schedule a visit with your doctor</b> for an evaluation.</p>
