					<h1>Heavy Menstrual Periods</h1>
<p>If you have been sexually active, a single heavy bleeding episode could be a sign of a new pregnancy. If you have not been sexually active in recent months or if you have had a hysterectomy (removal of your uterus), you can be certain that you are not pregnant. In all other cases, we would recommend a pregnancy test.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/heavy-menstrual-periods-21.html">I am certain I am not pregnant.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/heavy-menstrual-periods-20.html">I may be pregnant.</a></p>
