<p>In most cases, a single heavy period is caused by a temporary hormone imbalance. If the natural process of forming an egg and releasing it from the ovary (&quot;ovulation&quot;) does not happen normally, a period may be delayed, unusually heavy, or unusually long.

The medical term for heavy bleeding from a temporary hormone imbalance is &quot;dysfunctional uterine bleeding.&quot;</p><p>Sometimes treatment from your doctor is needed to help a very heavy period to stop. <b>Contact your doctor</b> if your bleeding continues to be heavy for longer than a week, or if you develop symptoms of dizziness or feeling faint.</p><p>Continue with this guide to learn about another possible cause of heavy periods.</p><p>Click  <a class="symptomPageLinkInline" href="/symptom/heavy-menstrual-periods-24.html">here</a> to continue.</p>
