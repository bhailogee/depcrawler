					<h1>Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy</h1>
<p>Some conditions that cause nausea and vomiting also can cause bleeding into the digestive tract. Blood in vomit can appear red or it can look dark and grainy, like coffee grounds, due to chemical changes from stomach acid. Blood in the stool may be black and have a tar-like texture.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><b>Have you vomited blood or &quot;coffee grounds,&quot; or have you noticed black tar-like stools?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nausea-and-vomiting-in-pregnancy-30.html">Yes.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/nausea-and-vomiting-in-pregnancy-16.html">No.</a></p>
