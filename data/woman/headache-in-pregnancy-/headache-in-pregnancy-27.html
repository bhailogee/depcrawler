					<h1>Headache in Pregnancy</h1>
<p>Most sinus infections are caused initially by a virus or allergies. Swelling and mucous buildup prevent the sinus from properly draining. Pressure increases inside the sinus, causing pain. You can safely use saline nasal sprays to help clear the mucus from the back of your nose and acetaminophen (Tylenol) to help decrease the pain. But be certain that you don&apos;t exceed the doses specified on the bottle. Women with liver disease such as chronic hepatitis should consult with the doctor or midwife prior to using acetaminophen.</p><p>Doctors and midwives have different opinions regarding the safety of decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine. Almost all recommend that women who are less than 14 weeks pregnant avoid them.</p><p>When the sinus problem is related to allergies, you might be able to take an antihistamine. Ask your doctor or midwife which one they prefer.</p><p>If the symptoms are not improving over two to three days, contact your doctor. Call sooner if the pain is getting worse or you develop a fever.</p>
