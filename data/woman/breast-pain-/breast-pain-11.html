					<h1>Breast Pain</h1>
<p>So far we have determined that you haven&apos;t felt a lump or have any nipple discharge. Also, you are not taking any of the medications that are likely to cause breast pain.</p><p>Perhaps you are feeling the pain in the breast but the origin of the pain is somewhere else. For example, if the breast pain is accompanied by marked skin sensitivity, then an irritated nerve might be the cause of the pain. You can test this by lightly rubbing the skin over and around the breast without pressing down.</p><p><b>Have you noticed that your skin is very sensitive on and around the breast (rather than pain inside the breast), or that there&apos;s a new rash in the area of pain?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/breast-pain-18.html">Yes, I have.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/breast-pain-12.html">No, this doesn&apos;t sound like me.</a></p>
