					<h1>Breast Pain</h1>
<p>Blood levels of female hormones, estrogen, and progesterone normally increase during pregnancy. These hormones cause breast tissue to swell and grow, preparing for the production of breast milk and breast-feeding. The breasts can become more sensitive and painful as the tissue swells and grows. Increased breast sensitivity is common during pregnancy but usually not enough to require pain medication.</p><p><b>Contact your doctor to discuss your concerns</b>, especially if your breast pain is worsening or persistent, or to confirm a suspected pregnancy.</p>
