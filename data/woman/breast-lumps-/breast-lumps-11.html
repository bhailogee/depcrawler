					<h1>Breast Lump Biopsy </h1>
<p>A breast biopsy is a sample of tissue taken directly from the breast. This can be done in the office by &quot;fine-needle aspiration,&quot; where the doctor inserts a very thin needle into the lump and draws up a tissue sample into a syringe. It can also be done as outpatient surgery, where the surgeon either takes a small piece of the lump or completely removes the lump.</p><p>With both procedures, the tissue sample is sent to the lab to see if cancerous cells are present.</p>
