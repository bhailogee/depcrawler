<p>That&apos;s reassuring to know you have no skin dimpling, indentations or nipple retraction.</p><p>Many women occasionally notice a white milky nipple discharge from one or both breasts, even if they are not pregnant or breast feeding. In general, this is not worrisome as long as a woman otherwise feels well and continues to have normal menstrual periods. A red or rust colored discharge means blood is probably present and could be a sign of a more serious problem.</p><p><b>Have you noticed any bloody nipple discharge?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/breast-lumps-9.html">Yes, I have noticed a bloody nipple discharge.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/breast-lumps-4.html">No, I have not noticed a bloody nipple discharge.</a></p>
