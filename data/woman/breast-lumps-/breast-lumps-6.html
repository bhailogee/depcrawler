					<h1>Multiple Breast Lumps </h1>
<p>You answer implies that you have one or more lumps that come and go and appear in different breast locations. This means the chance that a new lump is cancerous is quite small. This is especially true for lumps that show up only around the time of your menstrual period. Also these lumps are usually more swollen and painful around the time of menstruation.</p><p>Multiple lumps in both breasts usually indicate a condition called &quot;fibrocystic changes&quot; of the breasts, a common and noncancerous condition. Fibrocystic changes usually affect both breasts because the female hormones, estrogen and progesterone, cause breast tissue to swell and thicken around the time of menstruation. Some areas of the breasts will likely feel tenderer, firmer and more irregularly shaped than other areas.</p><p>To be certain, <b>contact your doctor</b> to discuss your symptoms and arrange to be seen.</p>
