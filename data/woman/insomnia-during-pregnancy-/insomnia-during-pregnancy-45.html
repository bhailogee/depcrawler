					<h1>Insomnia During Pregnancy</h1>
<p>Here are some tips to help reduce acid reflux:</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>- Don&apos;t eat large meals, especially late at night. Eat smaller meals during the day and have your last meal at least two hours before you get into bed.</p><p>- Avoid foods and drinks that you know give you heartburn. Those that cause heartburn most often include tomato-based products, spicy foods, fatty and fried foods, carbonated drinks, orange and grapefruit juice, mints and chocolates.</p><p>- Chew sugarless gum. It stimulates saliva production, which can neutralize stomach acid.</p><p>- Use pillows to prop yourself up in bed.</p><p>- Try to keep your weight gain within the limits recommended by your doctor or midwife.</p><p>- Don&apos;t smoke, and avoid alcohol (which you should avoid anyway for the health of your baby).</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Use over-the-counter antacids in moderation. Choose those that contain magnesium or calcium. They are the safest. However, don&apos;t exceed recommended doses. If you are unsure about how much you can take per day, contact your doctor, nurse, or midwife for advice.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>If you are not able to control acid reflux with these changes, acid-blocking medications are available over-the-counter and by prescription. <b>Ask your doctor, nurse, or midwife before taking anything stronger than antacids.</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/insomnia-during-pregnancy-46.html">Next</a></p>
