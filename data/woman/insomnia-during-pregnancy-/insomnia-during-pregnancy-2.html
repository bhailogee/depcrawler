					<h1>Insomnia During Pregnancy</h1>
<p>Most adults require seven to nine hours of sleep during each 24-hour period. Women&#xA0;who are pregnant might require even more sleep than that. Most people sleep at night; for those who work the afternoon or night shift, though, sleep happens during the day.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>It might seem obvious, but you need to set aside adequate time for sleep. Some women are so busy, or become so frustrated with lying in bed awake, that they don&apos;t give themselves enough time for sleep. If you aren&apos;t setting aside at least seven hours for sleep, then this would be your first step.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><b>Are you giving yourself enough time to get the sleep you need?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/insomnia-during-pregnancy-4.html">Yes, I am.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/insomnia-during-pregnancy-3.html">No, probably not.</a></p>
