<p>You are aware of increased body or facial hair. However, your doctor has found that your androgen blood levels are all normal. Many women develop increased body or facial hair without any rise in blood androgen levels.</p><p>Another cause of amenorrhea is an increased prolactin secretion by the pituitary gland. During pregnancy, the rise in blood pituitary levels is normal because prolactin exists to stimulate breastmilk production.</p><p>Women with high prolactin levels who are not pregnant may notice a milky discharge from the breasts. But not all women with high prolactin have this symptom. Their only symptom may be irregular or absent menstrual periods.</p><p>Your doctor will want to measure a blood prolactin level.</p><p><b>Call your doctor&apos;s office to arrange an appointment.</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/when-menstrual-periods-stop-17.html">What if my prolactin level is high?</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/when-menstrual-periods-stop-16.html">What if my prolactin level is normal?</a></p>
