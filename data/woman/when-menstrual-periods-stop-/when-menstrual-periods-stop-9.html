					<h1>When Menstrual Periods Stop</h1>
<p>One of the most common causes of irregular periods or periods that stop completely is stress. It may be a situation such as beginning college, starting a new job, losing a job, or having a very sick child at home. You may think that you are doing fine and not realize that you are under stress.</p><p>Although stress may be the sole reason for the amenorrhea, we should explore other possibilities, such as weight loss and conditions related to hormonal abnormalities.</p><p><b>Before your periods stopped, had you had weight loss of more than ten pounds?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/when-menstrual-periods-stop-11.html">Yes, I have had weight loss.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/when-menstrual-periods-stop-10.html">No, I have not lost weight.</a></p>
