<p>Menopause causes vaginal dryness because it causes low levels of estrogen, but it is not the only time in your life when low estrogen levels can occur. Estrogen levels are also decreased during the postpartum period and during months when you are breast feeding.</p><p><b>Are you postpartum or breast feeding?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/vaginal-dryness-10.html">Yes, I am postpartum or I am breast feeding a baby.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/vaginal-dryness-5.html">No, I am not.</a></p>
