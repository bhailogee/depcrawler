					<h1>Vaginal Dryness</h1>
<p>Vaginal dryness is particularly common during the menopause transition and in years that follow menopause. The average age for menopause is 51. During the menopause transition, within two or three years of a woman&apos;s decrease in estrogen levels, about one out of every five women experiences vaginal dryness. In later years, as many as one out of every two women notices vaginal dryness.</p><p>Vaginal dryness can also occur when a woman has both ovaries surgically removed. The reason is that this surgery can cause a woman to enter menopause.</p><p><b>Have you entered menopause (either recently or in the past)?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/vaginal-dryness-11.html">Yes, I am either in menopause or past menopause.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/vaginal-dryness-4.html">No, I have not entered menopause.</a></p>
