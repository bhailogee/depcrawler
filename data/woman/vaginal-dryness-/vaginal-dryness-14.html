					<h1>Vaginal Dryness</h1>
<p>If you use hormone replacement as a way to treat your vaginal dryness, you might need to take both estrogen and progesterone. If estrogen is used without progesterone, it can increase the risk for endometrial cancer (uterine cancer). Progesterone is prescribed to women who take estrogen because progesterone protects your uterus from this risk.</p><p>Uterine cancer risk is not a major concern for the low estrogen exposure that comes from local (vaginal-only) estrogen treatments. Women who are taking vaginal forms of estrogen may not need to take progesterone, although some experts still think it is wise if you are continuing your treatment for a long time.</p><p>To decide whether you will need systemic estrogen or local estrogen, we will need to know whether you are having other symptoms of menopause.</p><p><b>Are you having hot flashes?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/vaginal-dryness-15.html">Yes, I am having hot flashes.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/vaginal-dryness-20.html">No, I am not having hot flashes.</a></p>
