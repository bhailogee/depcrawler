<p>Estrogen can increase the risk for uterine cancer in women who have a uterus. Since your uterus has been removed, this is not a risk for you. You also do not need to take the hormone progesterone along with estrogen, since this additional hormone is used to lower the risk for uterine cancer.</p><p>If the dose is high enough, estrogen treatments for vaginal dryness can also relieve hot flashes. Hot flashes are a common symptom of menopause.</p><p><b>Are you experiencing hot flashes?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/vaginal-dryness-21.html">Yes, I am having hot flashes.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/vaginal-dryness-20.html">No, I am not having hot flashes.</a></p>
