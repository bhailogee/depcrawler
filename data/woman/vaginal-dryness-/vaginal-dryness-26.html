					<h1>Vaginal Dryness</h1>
<p>The first step to improve vaginal dryness during sex is to try to increase your natural lubrication.</p><p>If you increase the amount of time that you spend in foreplay (kissing, touching, and other romantic connections with your partner before sexual intercourse is attempted), you may find that you have more lubrication.</p><p>Since many women complain of irritation or dryness as a side effect from spermicide, you should avoid using spermicide as your form of birth control.</p><p>After trying these things, we recommend that you purchase an over-the-counter, water-soluble vaginal lubricant to use during sex. Examples include Astroglide and K-Y lubricant.</p>
