					<h1>Blood in the Urine in Women Treatment</h1>
<p>If you have any of these symptoms along with blood in your urine, you may have a bladder infection.</p><p>Bladder infections are very common and are treated with antibiotics. If you think you have a bladder infection, you should call your doctor so you can get appropriate antibiotic treatment. Bleeding caused by a bladder infection should stop within a few days after starting antibiotic treatment. If you still have blood in your urine after your infection has been fully treated, you should <b>be re-evaluated by your doctor</b> to find the cause of that bleeding.</p>
