					<h1>Birth Control (Contraception) for Women</h1>
<p>While you will want to avoid estrogen containing hormonal birth control, you probably will be able to use progesterone only methods of birth control. Or you might consider an IUD (intra-uterine device). If neither appeals to you, then you will want to use one of the barrier methods.</p><p>Progesterone only methods of birth control include the mini-pill, progesterone shots (once a month or once every 3 months) and progesterone implants placed under the skin by your doctor.</p><p>Barrier methods include male condoms, a diaphragm, a cervical cap, sponges and spermicides. Combining two barrier methods can offer extra protection against unwanted pregnancy.</p><p>For example, a male condom with a spermicide is a popular contraceptive method.</p><p>The only barrier method that can&apos;t be used with a male condom is the female condom. Male condoms should not be used at the same time with female condoms because their surfaces will rub and cause one or both to slip out of position or completely slip off.</p><p>By the way, if your only risk factor is smoking, quitting now would allow you to consider the estrogen options.</p>
