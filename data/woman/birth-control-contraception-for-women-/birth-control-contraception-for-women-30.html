					<h1>Birth Control (Contraception) for Women</h1>
<p>Since you have a higher than average risk of side effects related to hormonal contraception, your options may be more limited. Consider an IUD or a barrier method. Barrier methods are not as reliable as an IUD for pregnancy prevention.</p><p>Barrier methods include male condoms, a diaphragm, a cervical cap, sponges and spermicides. Combining two barrier methods can offer extra protection against unwanted pregnancy. For example, a male condom with a spermicide is a popular contraceptive method.</p><p>The only barrier method that can&apos;t be used with a male condom is the female condom. Male condoms should not be used at the same time with female condoms because their surfaces will rub and cause one or both to slip out of position or completely slip off.</p>
