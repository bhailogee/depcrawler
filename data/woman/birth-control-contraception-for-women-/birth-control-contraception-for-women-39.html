					<h1>Birth Control (Contraception) for Women</h1>
<p>So far your answers indicate that you are not currently sexually active. You also are sure that you don&apos;t want more children, no matter what might happen to your family.</p><p>Your options for permanent birth control include surgery to have your tubes tied (called tubal ligation) or micro-insertion tubal occlusion done in the doctor&apos;s office. Another option is to wait until you have a new partner and see if he would consider a vasectomy.</p><p>If you still want to keep the door open in the future, you can consider an IUD. Although the risk of pregnancy with an IUD is very small, it can happen and is not the best option for women who would be devastated to get pregnant.</p><p>Even if you choose a permanent method of birth control, remember to have your partner always use a condom when you start a new relationship.</p>
