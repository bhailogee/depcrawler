					<h1>Birth Control (Contraception) for Women</h1>
<p>Since you are having sex with multiple partners, you must protect yourself now from sexually transmitted diseases, as well as avoiding accidental pregnancy. Your best choice preventing sexually transmitted infections is to make sure that your partner uses a latex condom (unless you have a latex allergy) with every sexual penetration.</p><p>Male condoms can be combined with any barrier method, except the female condom, to greatly improve protection against pregnancy and infection. Male condoms should not be used at the same time with female condoms because their surfaces will rub and cause each other to slip out of position or completely slip off.</p><p>While condoms are important to help prevent sexually transmitted infections, they do not provide optimal pregnancy protection. You should use a second and more effective method to prevent pregnancy, IN ADDITION TO CONDOMS.</p><p><b>Do you have any children?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/birth-control-contraception-for-women-11.html">Yes, I have children.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/birth-control-contraception-for-women-10.html">No, I don&apos;t have children.</a></p>
