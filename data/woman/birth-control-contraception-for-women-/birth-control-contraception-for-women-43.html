					<h1>Birth Control (Contraception) for Women</h1>
<p>While you will want to avoid estrogen containing hormonal birth control, you probably will be able to use progesterone only methods of birth control. Or you might consider choosing a second barrier method in addition to male condoms.</p><p>Progesterone only methods of birth control include the mini-pill, progesterone shots (once a month or once every 3 months) and progesterone implants placed under the skin by your doctor.</p><p>The only barrier method that can&apos;t be used with a male condom is the female condom. Male condoms should not be used at the same time with female condoms because their surfaces will rub and cause one or both to slip out of position or completely slip off.</p><p>Second barrier methods that you can use include a diaphragm, cervical cap, sponges and spermicides.</p><p>An IUD (intra-uterine device) also may be an option for you.</p><p>By the way, if your only risk factor is smoking, quitting now would allow you to consider the estrogen options.</p>
