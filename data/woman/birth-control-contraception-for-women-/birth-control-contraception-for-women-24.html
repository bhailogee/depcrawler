					<h1>Birth Control (Contraception) for Women</h1>
<p>So far your answers indicate that you are sure that you don&apos;t ever want to have a child.</p><p>Getting your tubes tied (tubal ligation) or micro-insertion tubal occlusion done in the doctor&apos;s office are two options for you. Your male partner may be open to having a vasectomy. You should consider these procedures as permanent birth control.</p><p>You might still not want to do something that can&apos;t be reversed. If so, think about an IUD. Although the risk of pregnancy with an IUD is very small, it can happen and may not be the best option for a woman who would be devastated to get pregnant.</p>
