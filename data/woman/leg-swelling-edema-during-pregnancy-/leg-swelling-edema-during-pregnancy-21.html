					<h1>Leg Swelling (Edema) during Pregnancy</h1>
<p>Even after evaluation by your doctor, there may be no clear explanation for your leg swelling. That&apos;s because you could be one of the millions of people with &quot;idiopathic edema&quot; -- that means no specific cause can be found.</p><p>One reason this happens is that, as we age, the valves in our leg veins begin to work poorly. Normally, these valves prevent fluid from collecting where gravity takes it, such as the feet and lower legs. When the veins don&apos;t work well, swelling in the feet and legs is common. With this condition, lower extremity swelling tends to occur at the end of the day and resolve entirely (or mostly) after leg elevation, as during sleep. Treatment usually includes salt restriction, tight (compression) stockings, and leg elevation.</p><p>We hope you feel better soon!</p>
