					<h1>Vaginal Pain or Discomfort</h1>
<p>The nerves that signal pain in the uterus extend down into the vagina and labia. While the uterus is contracting to push out menstrual blood, those nerves can be irritated and pain can be felt within the vagina.</p><p>This is usually not a symptom of any serious condition. The medical term for pain during menstruation is &quot;dysmenorrhea.&quot; You can treat the symptoms of menstrual period pain with over-the-counter ibuprofen or acetaminophen.</p><p>Sometimes vaginal pain that occurs during menstruation can be caused by endometriosis. Endometriosis occurs when the type of tissue that lines the uterus is also located in places outside of the uterus. This tissue enlarges during prior to menstruation and it can create irritation in your pelvis or lower abdomen. If you have significant vaginal pain during menstruation, you should talk to your doctor about endometriosis.</p>
