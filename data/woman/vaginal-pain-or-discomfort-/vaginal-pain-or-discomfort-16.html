					<h1>Vaginal Pain or Discomfort</h1>
<p><b>Arrange a visit to discuss your symptoms with your doctor.</b></p><p>Painful sexual intercourse (dyspareunia) &#xA0;is very common following sexual trauma, and you may benefit from counseling. Your stress from past trauma is the most likely explanation for your pain.</p><p>Of course, there are other possible explanations for your pain. If you have pain that worsens prior to and during your menses with many of your menstrual cycles, it is possible that you have a condition named endometriosis. Endometriosis occurs when the type of tissue that lines the uterus is also located in places outside of the uterus. This tissue enlarges during prior to menstruation and it can create irritation in your pelvis or lower abdomen.</p>
