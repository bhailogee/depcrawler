					<h1>Vaginal Pain or Discomfort</h1>
<p>Your answers do not point to a specific cause of your vaginal discomfort. <b>Make an appointment with your doctor.</b></p><p>If you have pain that worsens prior to and during your menses with many of your menstrual cycles, it is possible that you have a condition named endometriosis. Endometriosis occurs when the type of tissue that lines the uterus is also located in places outside of the uterus. This tissue enlarges during prior to menstruation and it can create irritation in your pelvis or lower abdomen.</p>
