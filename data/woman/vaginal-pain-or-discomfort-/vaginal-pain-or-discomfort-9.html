					<h1>Vaginal Pain or Discomfort</h1>
<p>If you have pain or burning when you urinate, you may have a urinary tract infection.</p><p><b>Contact a doctor today</b> so you can be evaluated for a possible urinary tract infection. If you have an infection, you will need treatment with antibiotics.</p><p>It is also possible for burning with urination to be caused by irritation or infection in the urethra, the tube that drains the bladder. The urethra empties urine at the opening of the vagina. Irritation in the urethra is named&#xA0;urethritis. Urethritis can be caused by infection (such as the sexually transmitted diseases chlamydia or gonorrhea) but it can also result from chemical irritation or an allergy reaction after use of bubble bath, spermicides, latex condoms, or other products.</p><p>Women who are past menopause can have irritation caused by thinning and sensitivity of the tissue that lines the urethra and vagina. After menopause there is less estrogen in the body. Estrogen keeps the vaginal lining and urethra well lubricated. Without estrogen, the vaginal lining can get irritated easily (atrophic vaginitis) and pain may occur with urination. Creams that contain estrogen or estrogen supplements by pills or patches may help.</p><p>Estrogen supplementation after menopause has possible side effects. Estrogen-containing creams deliver only small amounts of estrogen to the rest of your body, but they need to be provided by a doctor after a discussion of possible side effects.</p>
