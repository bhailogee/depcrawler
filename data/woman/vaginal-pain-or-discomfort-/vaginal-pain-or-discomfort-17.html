					<h1>Vaginal Pain or Discomfort</h1>
<p>You have indicated that you have entered menopause and are having vaginal pain that is worse with sex.</p><p>After menopause there is less estrogen in the body. Estrogen keeps the vaginal lining well lubricated and keeps the tissues that line the vagina more capable of stretching. Without estrogen, the vaginal lining can get very dry and less elastic, a condition called&#xA0;atrophic vaginitis. This can result in painful sexual intercourse (dyspareunia).</p><p>You can try using over-the-counter lubricants to help with the dryness. If this is not effective, you should talk with your doctor. Creams that contain estrogen or estrogen supplements by pills or patches may work better for you. Estrogen supplementation after menopause has possible side effects. Estrogen-containing creams deliver only small amounts of estrogen to the rest of your body, but they need to be provided by a doctor after a discussion of possible side effects.</p>
