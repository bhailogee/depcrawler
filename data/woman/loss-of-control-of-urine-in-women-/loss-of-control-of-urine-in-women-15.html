					<h1>Loss of Control of Urine in Women</h1>
<p>Normally, when a woman has the urge to empty her bladder, the muscles around the opening of the bladder contract to hold back the urine until she reaches the bathroom. Once on the toilet she can willfully allow those muscles to relax. Women with urge incontinence do not have the ability to contract enough to hold back the urine. They will leak urine or empty their bladder before they can make it to the bathroom.</p><p>Urge incontinence, like stress incontinence, can be treated with scheduled voiding. This way, the bladder is emptied regularly and you decrease the chances of leaking at inopportune moments. If the scheduled voiding does not work, there are medications that can be tried which affect the muscles of the bladder and prevent incontinence.</p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/loss-of-control-of-urine-in-women-16.html">Click here to continue,</a></p>
