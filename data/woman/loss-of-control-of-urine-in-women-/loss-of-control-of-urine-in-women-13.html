					<h1>Loss of Control of Urine in Women</h1>
<p>If you have stopped having menstrual periods, your loss of urine control may be related to menopause.</p><p>With menopause, a woman has much less estrogen production. Estrogen helps to keep the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the bladder) strong with a smooth lining. The loss of estrogen&apos;s positive effects on the urethra contributes to decreased urine control for some women.</p><p>However, you have indicated that your loss of urine control just started. So you probably will want to wait a few more days, since it may be a temporary situation.</p>
