					<h1>Loss of Control of Urine in Women</h1>
<p>The symptoms you described are classic for what is called stress incontinence. Coughing, laughing and exercising put excess stress on the pelvic muscles. Since they have been stretched, they do not work as well as they used to and you leak urine.</p><p>There are several treatments for stress incontinence.</p><p>One common treatment is Kegel exercises. The exercises can strengthen the pelvic muscles and give you better urinary control.</p><p>Another treatment is scheduled voiding. By emptying the bladder at regular intervals, there is very little urine left in the bladder to leak when you do cough or strain.</p><p>There is also surgical treatment but this is usually recommended only when other more conservative therapies have been ineffective.</p>
