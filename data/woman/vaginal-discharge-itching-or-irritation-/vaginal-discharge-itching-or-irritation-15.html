					<h1>Vaginal Discharge, Itching or Irritation</h1>
<p>Based on your symptoms, you may have a yeast infection.</p><p>A sparse amount of yeast normally grows in the vagina and normally doesn&apos;t cause any problems. When too much yeast accumulates, you can have symptoms of a yeast infection. Changes in the acidity of the vaginal mucus or changes in the bacteria that normally grows within the vagina can make the vagina a more yeast-friendly environment, promoting the growth of yeast. These changes can be caused by antibiotic treatment. These changes may also result after exposure to semen or douches, or they may result from menstruation.</p><p>If yeast in the vagina multiply, this can create discharge, itching and irritation.</p><p>Yeast infections can be treated effectively with over-the-counter vaginal creams such as miconazole (Monistat), clotrimazole (Gyne-Lotrimin), or tioconazole (Monistat 1-Day). Most anti-yeast creams require at least several days to have their full effect. If an anti-yeast cream does not work, you should talk to your doctor about other treatments.</p><p>A one-time dose of oral anti-fungal medicine may be prescribed by your doctor as an alternative to vaginal cream treatment.</p><p>Some women have a lot of yeast infections, or have yeast infections that don&apos;t clear up easily with usual over-the-counter creams. When this is true, it is possible that a medical illness may be causing the infections.</p><p><b>Do you have yeast infections that occur frequently or have infections that don&apos;t clear up easily with usual treatment?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/vaginal-discharge-itching-or-irritation-17.html">Yes, they are either frequent or stubborn.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/vaginal-discharge-itching-or-irritation-16.html">No, I have not been troubled by frequent yeast infections</a></p>
