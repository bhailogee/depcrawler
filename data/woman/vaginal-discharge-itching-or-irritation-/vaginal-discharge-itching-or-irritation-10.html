					<h1>Vaginal Discharge, Itching or Irritation</h1>
<p>All of these can irritate the inside of the vagina. Doctors recommend not using douches, since they change the normal environment of the vagina and may make you more likely to get yeast infections. They are also irritants to the vaginal lining.</p><p>Many women have allergies to latex and condoms are often made out of latex. Latex condoms can be very irritating to these women. If you are using latex condoms, try another kind to see if your symptoms improve when you avoid latex.</p><p>If you are still experiencing vaginal irritation, <b>talk with your doctor.</b></p>
