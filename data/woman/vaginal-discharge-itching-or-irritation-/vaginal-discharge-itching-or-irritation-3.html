					<h1>Vaginal Discharge, Itching or Irritation</h1>
<p>There are many changes in the body that occur after a woman stops menstruating. A woman has lower levels of estrogen present in her body after menopause. When estrogen is abundant, it keeps the vaginal lining soft and moist. After menopause, women often experience vaginal dryness and irritation. Intercourse may be uncomfortable for this reason.</p><p>This dryness and irritation can usually be treated with over-the-counter lubricants such as Replens or K-Y Vaginal Moisturizer. If over-the-counter lubricant treatment is not effective your doctor may prescribe other treatments, including estrogen cream.</p><p>Click below to learn about  <a class="symptomPageLinkInline" href="/symptom/vaginal-discharge-itching-or-irritation-4.html">other causes of vaginal discomfort</a>.</p>
