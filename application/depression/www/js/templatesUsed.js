That can mean feeling low, blue, or sad, but sometimes depression appears as irritability or not being able to enjoy everyday activities.</p><p>Physical changes: People with mood disorders may also develop changes in appetite, sleep, or energy.</p><p>The purpose of this guide is to help you better understand what depression is. This guide is not designed or intended to make a diagnosis. But knowing more about the condition often makes it easier to talk with a doctor about the symptoms you are experiencing.</p><p><a class="button button-block button-positive" ui-sref="app.depression-2">Click here to begin.</a></p>\n\n			 ';

It&apos;s important that your doctor is aware of what you are feeling, especially if you have or suspect you may have a medical condition. Your doctor&apos;s ability to evaluate these possibilities can help to determine what treatment is best.</p><p>Sometimes the illness is obvious -- for example, depression can be a symptom of heart or kidney disease, cancer, or a neurologic illness.</p><p>But from time to time, a medical illness hasn&apos;t been discovered and depression is the first thing to appear. For example, a person might have anemia or an underactive thyroid and would not know it without the help of a doctor.</p><p>A primary care physician can review health status and make sure there is no significant medical illness that could be at the root of a mood change.</p><p><b>Do you think a medical condition may be contributing to the symptoms?</b></p><p><a class="button button-block button-positive" ui-sref="app.depression-12">Yes, it&apos;s possible.</a></p><p><a class="button button-block button-positive" ui-sref="app.depression-11">No, I don&apos;t think so.</a></p>\n\n			 ';

If these feelings or symptoms occurred in other circumstances, it might readily be called a depression.</p><p>In the case of the death of a loved one, depression-like symptoms are fairly common in the first few months. Symptoms can include odd illusions, such as imagining that the dead are still alive, feeling their presence, or hearing them call out. These symptoms can be very upsetting, but are usually within the range of normal responses to the loss. They call for comfort and practical assistance.</p><p>The symptoms can linger, though, making it difficult for the bereaved person to function. When symptoms go on for a long time -- more than 6 months -- without any sign of improving or resolving, treatment may ease the emotional pain and help the person go back to participating in life.</p><p>The risk of developing this kind of problem (sometimes called complicated grief) depends on both the immediate circumstances of the death or loss and the background against which it occurs. Also, some people are simply more vulnerable to developing depression after a significant loss, for example, because of their genetic make-up or how their ability to cope has developed over time.</p><p><a class="button button-block button-positive" ui-sref="app.depression-17">Click here to move to stress and depression.</a></p><p><a class="button button-block button-positive" ui-sref="app.depression-18">Click here to continue with the guide.</a></p>\n\n			 ';
      x['depression-17'] = '\n					<h1>Depression</h1>\n<p>Stress has an enormous impact on mood. In the short run, it can make you feel lousy. In the long run, it increases the chances you&apos;ll become depressed.</p><p>If you are facing a new stress -- one that is bothering you now, but is likely to pass -- your symptoms may pass once the stress is gone. Sometimes that is called an adjustment disorder. The term adjustment disorder is used when someone develops symptoms within a few months of a known stress.</p><p>In one sense, mild symptoms of depression or anxiety are a normal response to stress. Stress itself is an expected part of life, from childhood on. Learning to manage developmental hurdles and hazards is a key to growing up.</p><p>There is no clear benchmark to indicate when stress is too much, or at what point a normal response becomes a disorder. Yet, whenever there is emotional discomfort or functioning begins to suffer, it makes sense to get help. Adjustment disorders respond readily to treatment.</p><p>Let&apos;s try to put stress reactions in some context. Human responses to stress and trauma are extremely varied. In fact, the most common response to stress is to develop no psychiatric disorder at all. This is certainly a tribute to the human capacity for coping. Still, certain kinds of problems are worth noting.</p><p>The death of a parent has an enormous impact whenever it occurs in childhood, although the consequences can be eased if there is adequate support for family members. Unfortunately, a death in early childhood usually means life has also been turned upside down for the surviving parent. Other potential caregivers are also likely to be grieving. The meaning of such a loss remains significant throughout life and there is a higher risk for depression.</p><p>Sexual abuse and physical abuse are also associated with higher rates of depression. In addition to the impact on self-esteem, it is thought that such experiences induce physiological stress responses that may increase the vulnerability to depression.</p><p>Cumulative stress seems also to be important, and may have a multiplying effect.</p><p>Descriptions of stress are very personal. Anyone who reports a stressful experience is reporting on their own <i>perception</i> of it. Researchers therefore have some difficulty comparing reports of stress from person to person. Put two people in the same circumstances and they are likely to describe it differently. People who report stress may be innately less resistant to the ups and downs of &quot;normal&quot; life, or they have in fact been exposed to higher levels of stress or trauma.</p><p>Do stressful experiences cause depression or does a depressed person experience more stress than other people in the same situation? Probably both. The more stresses you have, the more likely you are to become depressed. And the more episodes of depression you have, the easier it is to become depressed after a relatively small stress.</p><p><a class="button button-block button-positive" ui-sref="app.depression-18">Click here to continue with the guide.</a></p>\n\n			 ';

First let&apos;s focus on mood.</p><p>There is no clear dividing line between mildly, moderately, or severely depressed mood. Even so-called &quot;mild&quot; depression can feel pretty awful.</p><p>Severely depressed mood seeps into every corner of life. You can&apos;t shake it. You might feel very sad, empty, or irritable. It feels distinctly different from anything you might consider normal, and leads to a sense of paralysis. You feel hopeless and worthless, you don&apos;t have the energy or desire to do anything, and you are simply not able to do the things you are normally expected to do.</p><p>If your mood fits this description, choose &quot;severe depressed mood.&quot; If not, choose &quot;mild to moderate depressed mood.&quot;</p><p><b>How severe is your depression?</b></p><p><a class="button button-block button-positive" ui-sref="app.depression-20">Severe depressed mood.</a></p><p><a class="button button-block button-positive" ui-sref="app.depression-19">Mild to moderate depressed mood.</a></p>\n\n			 ';

They often ask questions about it in people who have symptoms of depression.</p><p>Relieving suffering from depression should reduce the risk of suicide.</p><p>The best approach to helping a person who is thinking about suicide is to treat the underlying problem or problems.

When mood varies with the seasons, it is more common for low mood to start in the fall or winter months as days grow shorter; then mood improves again in the spring. Winter blues are pretty common, especially in areas where winters are darker and longer. A few people have the opposite pattern, with depression occurring in the summer.</p><p><b>Does your depression recur each year at the same time, during a specific season, such as fall or winter?</b></p><p><a class="button button-block button-positive" ui-sref="app.depression-28">Yes, it does seem to be seasonal.</a></p><p><a class="button button-block button-positive" ui-sref="app.depression-23">No, it&apos;s not related to specific seasons.</a></p>\n\n			 ';

In a sense, each of us is atypical. No two forms of depression are alike.</p><p>Instead of being concerned about &quot;diagnosing&quot; depression, it may be better to think instead about being alert to mood problems and getting them evaluated by a trained professional. The different diagnostic categories give you and your healthcare provider a framework for evaluating the problems you have.</p><p>In fact, most people don&apos;t fit perfectly into one specific category. Over time, the goal is to gradually define your specific problems and to carefully review treatment options, understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each. All the while, it&apos;s good to keep an open mind, trying different approaches until you figure out what works best.</p><p>Sometimes a depression is called &quot;atypical&quot; because another illness is more significant: another psychiatric illness (for example, an eating disorder or anxiety disorder); a problem with substance use or abuse; a medical illness (like an underactive thyroid gland); or a medication effect (for example, a side effect of prednisone).

In the same way that dysthymia is a long lasting, but less intense version of depression than major depression, cyclothymia is a scaled down version of bipolar disorder.</p><p>The highs and lows of people with cyclothymia are less extreme than the mood changes in bipolar disorder, although they are more troublesome than the usual ups and downs of life. Cyclothymia can lead to disturbed personal relationships, difficulties at work, and alcohol or drug abuse. Often these problems are regarded as the person&apos;s normal way of being, and the underlying mood disorder goes unnoticed and untreated.</p><p>The pattern can begin early in life (in the teens or twenties) and last indefinitely.

The depressed mood should be related to the season itself, rather than a reaction to periodic stress that occurs at the same time every year (like starting a new school year or an annual work commitment).</p><p>The winter doldrums are not rare, especially in areas of the country where winters are colder and longer. Seasonal affective disorder is found more in northern states than southern states. Throughout the world, it is more common farther from the equator. It is more common in women than men.</p><p>Experts believe that reductions in the amount of light are an important factor in bringing on the mood changes. Biological rhythms are synchronized with periods of light and dark, and mood regulation is linked to these rhythms in the brain.</p><p>Colder weather that keeps people inside and reduces their activity level may also be a factor. Reduction in exercise levels can depress a person&apos;s mood. Also, when people stay inside, they take less advantage of whatever bright sunlight is available.</p><p>There may be a connection between seasonal affective disorder and bipolar disorder. Scientists think so, because the depression in seasonal affective disorder (which causes increased sleep and appetite, along with low energy and weight gain) is similar to the depression seen in bipolar disorder. In fact, many people with a seasonal mood pattern do have bipolar disorder. People with bipolar disorder sometimes have manic or hypomanic episodes in a seasonal pattern, too -- those episodes occur more frequently in summer.

      x['depression-31'] = '\n					<h1>Depression</h1>\n<p>Sometimes mood does not only go down. It can also go up, sometimes up too much, a condition that is called &quot;mania.&quot; One dictionary defines mania as &quot;an excessively intense enthusiasm, interest, or desire.&quot;</p><p>The definition of the <i>psychological condition</i> called mania or a manic episode is much more specific. The term mania does refer to a period of high mood, and in a manic episode a person may experience extreme elation. But you shouldn&apos;t mistake this mood with simply feeling good, because the elation can come apart in a moment. It is common for a person who is manic to be terribly irritable.</p><p>Added to the change in mood is a decreased need for sleep and an increase in energy and activity. People in a manic episode think unrealistically, often wildly overestimating their own abilities or importance. Thinking and talking may speed up; activity is scattered and unproductive. The person often is easily distracted and has very poor judgment, leading to actions that can be painful or embarrassing.</p><p>Sometimes the person with mania has delusions, or false beliefs. These beliefs may be consistent with the person&apos;s exaggerated sense of self.

      x['depression-42'] = '\n					<h1>Depression</h1>\n<p></p><p>Bipolar disorder is often called by its older name, manic-depressive illness, because people with the illness can have both manic (high) and depressive (low) episodes. The current term, bipolar, refers to the two poles of the illness, up and down.</p><p>Everyone has ups and downs. Most of us feel somewhat blue or delighted or irritated depending on daily circumstances. In bipolar disorder, however, moods are very different from normal mood. Although, to the untrained eye, the presence of mania may not be obvious, it is usually clear that something is wrong -- for example, the person may be unusually extravagant or nasty, or may be sleeping very little.</p><p>Mood disorders are grouped by type of mood (whether low or elevated) and by severity. The hallmark of bipolar disorder is the manic episode, a period of extreme elation or irritability. During such periods, an individual will likely have a decreased need for sleep and may have an expansive or grandiose sense of self. Thinking and talking may speed up, with speech sometimes called &quot;pressured.&quot;</p><p>A person can become very active, but in a scattered and unproductive way, sometimes with painful or embarrassing consequences. Examples are spending more money than is wise or getting involved in sexual adventures that are later regretted. What sometimes distinguishes mania is that a person makes these choices without giving <i>any</i> thought to the repercussions.</p><p>Of course, it would not be bipolar illness without two poles.</p><p>The vast majority of people with bipolar disorder do become depressed at some point. Along with a distinct low mood, there may be a change in weight or appetite (up or down), disturbed sleep, low energy, poor concentration, feelings of guilt, a lack of interest in usually pleasurable things, and thoughts of death or suicide.</p><p>Sometimes both manic and depressive symptoms overlap or alternate rapidly. In that case, it is called a mixed episode. It may be difficult to tell whether depression or mania is the predominant mood.</p><p>Some people with bipolar disorder develop psychotic symptoms. The term psychosis refers to a problem in making judgments about reality. Examples of psychotic symptoms are delusions (false beliefs) and hallucinations (false perceptions). Typically, during a manic episode, delusions are grandiose (if the mood is elevated) or paranoid or suspicious (if the mood is irritable).</p><p>In bipolar disorder, both manic and depressive episodes are quite likely to recur, especially if the person does not seek treatment.</p><p>Bipolar disorder occurs in approximately one percent of the general population. Unlike other depressive disorders, where women are more frequently diagnosed, the incidence of bipolar disorder is about equal in men and women.</p><p>The most important risk of bipolar disorder is the risk of suicide. Also, there is a high incidence of alcohol and substance abuse and, during manic periods, people may run into trouble with the law. The poor judgment and irrationally exuberant behavior seen during a manic episode can ruin lives, either through self-destructive spending or through embarrassing dealings or hurtful relationships.</p><p><b>If you suspect that you or a loved one has bipolar disorder, seek an evaluation with a psychiatrist</b>. It is often difficult to overcome the reluctance to get a consultation, but treatment can make a dramatic and helpful difference.</p><p>In bipolar disorder, the first line of medication treatment includes drugs called mood stabilizers, which are different from antidepressants. Also, if psychosis is part of the illness, drugs called antipsychotics may  be prescribed. Psychotherapy is important, too, because it will help a person come to terms with the illness and the problems caused by the illness.</p><p>\n<br>\n</p><h2>Feedback <img src="/img/label/beta.gif" alt="beta"></h2>\n<p class="tiny">Please provide feedback to help us improve the Drugs.com Symptom Checker.</p>\n<form action="/symptom-checker-feedback.php" method="post" class="symptom-form">\n	<div class="input-wrap">\n		<label class="" for="feedback_email">Email</label> <span class="tiny">(optional)</span>\n		<input class="" type="email" name="email" id="feedback_email" value="">\n	</div>\n	<div class="input-wrap">\n		<label class="" for="feedback">Feedback</label>\n		<textarea class="" name="feedback" id="feedback" rows="5"></textarea>\n	</div>\n	<input class="input-button" type="submit" value="Submit">\n\n</form>\n\n			 ';

Sometimes the same genetic factors that lead to depression also result in addiction. Probably several genes working together control traits that make someone vulnerable to substance dependence. Some genes shape our preferences. Others influence our sensitivity to a substance&apos;s intoxicating effects. Still others govern how quickly we become physically addicted.</p><p>Alcohol and drugs can cause many medical problems. Substance abuse is linked to brain damage, stroke, liver disease, heart disease, digestive problems, and cancer. When substances impair judgment (as they often do), people do unhealthy things. They are more at risk for car accidents, drowning, and falling. They may engage in unsafe sex, exposing themselves to illnesses like HIV and herpes. Any of these things can contribute to depression.</p><p>In addition to the physical effects they cause, substances can create havoc in a person&apos;s life. Relationships become tenser. There is a higher risk of divorce and domestic violence. Work gets derailed, leading to poor school or work performance and ultimately unemployment.</p><p>People turn to substances initially as a balm or an escape from painful emotions. The substances, though, tend to amplify rather than reduce the stress in a person&apos;s life.</p><p>Depression and substance use feed each other. Sometimes substance abuse is a hidden reason why treatment for depression fails. No matter which comes first, it is always important to treat the depression and the substance problem together.
