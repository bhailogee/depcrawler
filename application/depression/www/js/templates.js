That can mean feeling low, blue, or sad, but sometimes depression appears as irritability or not being able to enjoy everyday activities.</p><p>Physical changes: People with mood disorders may also develop changes in appetite, sleep, or energy.</p><p>The purpose of this guide is to help you better understand what depression is. This guide is not designed or intended to make a diagnosis. But knowing more about the condition often makes it easier to talk with a doctor about the symptoms you are experiencing.</p><p><a class="subdued" href="/#/symptom/depression-2">Click here to begin.</a></p>\n\n			 ';

But it can take intense forms that surprise a bereaved person. If these feelings or symptoms occurred in other circumstances, it might readily be called a depression.</p><p>In the case of the death of a loved one, depression-like symptoms are fairly common in the first few months. Symptoms can include odd illusions, such as imagining that the dead are still alive, feeling their presence, or hearing them call out. These symptoms can be very upsetting, but are usually within the range of normal responses to the loss. They call for comfort and practical assistance.</p><p>The symptoms can linger, though, making it difficult for the bereaved person to function. When symptoms go on for a long time -- more than 6 months -- without any sign of improving or resolving, treatment may ease the emotional pain and help the person go back to participating in life.</p><p>The risk of developing this kind of problem (sometimes called complicated grief) depends on both the immediate circumstances of the death or loss and the background against which it occurs. Also, some people are simply more vulnerable to developing depression after a significant loss, for example, because of their genetic make-up or how their ability to cope has developed over time.</p><p><a class="subdued" href="/#/symptom/depression-17">Click here to move to stress and depression.</a></p><p><a class="subdued" href="/#/symptom/depression-18">Click here to continue with the guide.</a></p>\n\n			 ';
        x['depression-17'] = '\n					<h1>Depression</h1>\n<p>Stress has an enormous impact on mood. In the short run, it can make you feel lousy. In the long run, it increases the chances you&apos;ll become depressed.</p><p>If you are facing a new stress -- one that is bothering you now, but is likely to pass -- your symptoms may pass once the stress is gone. Sometimes that is called an adjustment disorder. The term adjustment disorder is used when someone develops symptoms within a few months of a known stress.</p><p>In one sense, mild symptoms of depression or anxiety are a normal response to stress. Stress itself is an expected part of life, from childhood on. Learning to manage developmental hurdles and hazards is a key to growing up.</p><p>There is no clear benchmark to indicate when stress is too much, or at what point a normal response becomes a disorder. Yet, whenever there is emotional discomfort or functioning begins to suffer, it makes sense to get help. Adjustment disorders respond readily to treatment.</p><p>Let&apos;s try to put stress reactions in some context. Human responses to stress and trauma are extremely varied. In fact, the most common response to stress is to develop no psychiatric disorder at all. This is certainly a tribute to the human capacity for coping. Still, certain kinds of problems are worth noting.</p><p>The death of a parent has an enormous impact whenever it occurs in childhood, although the consequences can be eased if there is adequate support for family members. Unfortunately, a death in early childhood usually means life has also been turned upside down for the surviving parent. Other potential caregivers are also likely to be grieving. The meaning of such a loss remains significant throughout life and there is a higher risk for depression.</p><p>Sexual abuse and physical abuse are also associated with higher rates of depression. In addition to the impact on self-esteem, it is thought that such experiences induce physiological stress responses that may increase the vulnerability to depression.</p><p>Cumulative stress seems also to be important, and may have a multiplying effect.</p><p>Descriptions of stress are very personal. Anyone who reports a stressful experience is reporting on their own <i>perception</i> of it. Researchers therefore have some difficulty comparing reports of stress from person to person. Put two people in the same circumstances and they are likely to describe it differently. People who report stress may be innately less resistant to the ups and downs of &quot;normal&quot; life, or they have in fact been exposed to higher levels of stress or trauma.</p><p>Do stressful experiences cause depression or does a depressed person experience more stress than other people in the same situation? Probably both. The more stresses you have, the more likely you are to become depressed. And the more episodes of depression you have, the easier it is to become depressed after a relatively small stress.</p><p><a class="subdued" href="/#/symptom/depression-18">Click here to continue with the guide.</a></p>\n\n			 ';
        x['depression-18'] = '\n					<h1>Depression</h1>\n<p>Now, it&apos;s time to consider the severity of your depression. The severity of depression is always hard to estimate. First let&apos;s focus on mood.</p><p>There is no clear dividing line between mildly, moderately, or severely depressed mood. Even so-called &quot;mild&quot; depression can feel pretty awful.</p><p>Severely depressed mood seeps into every corner of life. You can&apos;t shake it. You might feel very sad, empty, or irritable. It feels distinctly different from anything you might consider normal, and leads to a sense of paralysis. You feel hopeless and worthless, you don&apos;t have the energy or desire to do anything, and you are simply not able to do the things you are normally expected to do.</p><p>If your mood fits this description, choose &quot;severe depressed mood.&quot; If not, choose &quot;mild to moderate depressed mood.&quot;</p><p><b>How severe is your depression?</b></p><p><a class="subdued" href="/#/symptom/depression-20">Severe depressed mood.</a></p><p><a class="subdued" href="/#/symptom/depression-19">Mild to moderate depressed mood.</a></p>\n\n			 ';

They often ask questions about it in people who have symptoms of depression.</p><p>Relieving suffering from depression should reduce the risk of suicide.</p><p>The best approach to helping a person who is thinking about suicide is to treat the underlying problem or problems.

When mood varies with the seasons, it is more common for low mood to start in the fall or winter months as days grow shorter; then mood improves again in the spring. Winter blues are pretty common, especially in areas where winters are darker and longer.

In a sense, each of us is atypical. No two forms of depression are alike.</p><p>Instead of being concerned about &quot;diagnosing&quot; depression, it may be better to think instead about being alert to mood problems and getting them evaluated by a trained professional. The different diagnostic categories give you and your healthcare provider a framework for evaluating the problems you have.</p><p>In fact, most people don&apos;t fit perfectly into one specific category. Over time, the goal is to gradually define your specific problems and to carefully review treatment options, understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each. All the while, it&apos;s good to keep an open mind, trying different approaches until you figure out what works best.</p><p>Sometimes a depression is called &quot;atypical&quot; because another illness is more significant: another psychiatric illness (for example, an eating disorder or anxiety disorder); a problem with substance use or abuse; a medical illness (like an underactive thyroid gland); or a medication effect (for example, a side effect of prednisone).

In the same way that dysthymia is a long lasting, but less intense version of depression than major depression, cyclothymia is a scaled down version of bipolar disorder.</p><p>The highs and lows of people with cyclothymia are less extreme than the mood changes in bipolar disorder, although they are more troublesome than the usual ups and downs of life. Cyclothymia can lead to disturbed personal relationships, difficulties at work, and alcohol or drug abuse. Often these problems are regarded as the person&apos;s normal way of being, and the underlying mood disorder goes unnoticed and untreated.</p><p>The pattern can begin early in life (in the teens or twenties) and last indefinitely.

Substance abuse is linked to brain damage, stroke, liver disease, heart disease, digestive problems, and cancer. When substances impair judgment (as they often do), people do unhealthy things.
