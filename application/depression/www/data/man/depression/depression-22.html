<p>Patterns of depression are very varied. The next few questions will help you think about a few variations, and may indicate what kind of treatment might be best.</p><p>Some people find their moods shift with the seasons. When mood varies with the seasons, it is more common for low mood to start in the fall or winter months as days grow shorter; then mood improves again in the spring. Winter blues are pretty common, especially in areas where winters are darker and longer. A few people have the opposite pattern, with depression occurring in the summer.</p><p><b>Does your depression recur each year at the same time, during a specific season, such as fall or winter?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/#/symptom/depression-28">Yes, it does seem to be seasonal.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/#/symptom/depression-23">No, it&apos;s not related to specific seasons.</a></p>
