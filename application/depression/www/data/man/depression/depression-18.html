					<h1>Depression</h1>
<p>Now, it&apos;s time to consider the severity of your depression. The severity of depression is always hard to estimate. First let&apos;s focus on mood.</p><p>There is no clear dividing line between mildly, moderately, or severely depressed mood. Even so-called &quot;mild&quot; depression can feel pretty awful.</p><p>Severely depressed mood seeps into every corner of life. You can&apos;t shake it. You might feel very sad, empty, or irritable. It feels distinctly different from anything you might consider normal, and leads to a sense of paralysis. You feel hopeless and worthless, you don&apos;t have the energy or desire to do anything, and you are simply not able to do the things you are normally expected to do.</p><p>If your mood fits this description, choose &quot;severe depressed mood.&quot; If not, choose &quot;mild to moderate depressed mood.&quot;</p><p><b>How severe is your depression?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/#/symptom/depression-20">Severe depressed mood.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/#/symptom/depression-19">Mild to moderate depressed mood.</a></p>
