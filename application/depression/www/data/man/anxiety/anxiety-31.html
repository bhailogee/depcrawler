					<h1>Anxiety</h1>
<p>Some people have anxiety problems as a result of a severely traumatic experience.</p><p>For the purposes of this question, trauma is defined as an event where you were threatened with death or severe injury, or you were close by when someone else was threatened in this way. As a result of this experience, you would have felt very afraid or helpless. Examples would be frightening wartime experiences or being the victim of a violent crime.</p><p>Losses, such as the death of a loved one after a prolonged illness, are very painful and may lead to anxiety, but do not fit the definition for this question. (Experiences of loss and milder forms of trauma are dealt with in another question.)</p><p><b>Have you been exposed to a severe traumatic event or life experience in the past?</b></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/anxiety-36.html">Yes, I have experienced severe trauma.</a></p><p><a class="symptomPageLink" href="/symptom/anxiety-32.html">No, I have not experienced severe trauma.</a></p>
