Perimenopause symptoms may occur up to 15 years prior to a woman losing her period completely. If these symptoms are more than a small bother, you should talk to your primary care physician, gynecologist or a mental health professional about ways to manage these symptoms.</p><p>You will probably need the help of your primary care physician to figure out if you have a medical problem that needs attention.</p>
