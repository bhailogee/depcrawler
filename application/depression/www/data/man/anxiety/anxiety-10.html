					<h1>Anxiety Disorder</h1>
<p>You may have social anxiety disorder.</p><p>A person with social anxiety disorder may find it impossible to be in any public situation because of being irrationally self-conscious. You may have an intense fear of being criticized or negatively evaluated by others. A public situation may cause you to be anxious as you anticipate it. Severe anxiety or even panic may occur once you are in the situation itself.</p><p>Anyone may have these fears from time to time, but the disorder can be disabling. Fortunately, the disorder is very treatable. Symptoms can be significantly reduced or even eliminated with some combination of psychotherapy and medication.</p>
